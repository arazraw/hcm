39800435;CTCA;Plaque detection;End-to-end deep-learning model for the detection of coronary artery stenosis on coronary CT images.;PURPOSE: We examined whether end-to-end deep-learning models could detect moderate (>/=50%) or severe (>/=70%) stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA) or left circumflex artery (LCX) in iodine contrast-enhanced ECG-gated coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans. METHODS: From a database of 6293 CCTA scans, we used pre-existing curved multiplanar reformations (CMR) images of the LAD, RCA and LCX arteries to create end-to-end deep-learning models for the detection of moderate or severe stenoses. We preprocessed the images by exploiting domain knowledge and employed a transfer learning approach using EfficientNet, ResNet, DenseNet and Inception-ResNet, with a class-weighted strategy optimised through cross-validation. Heatmaps were generated to indicate critical areas identified by the models, aiding clinicians in understanding the model's decision-making process. RESULTS: Among the 900 CMR cases, 279 involved the LAD artery, 259 the RCA artery and 253 the LCX artery. EfficientNet models outperformed others, with EfficientNetB3 and EfficientNetB0 demonstrating the highest accuracy for LAD, EfficientNetB2 for RCA and EfficientNetB0 for LCX. The area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) reached 0.95 for moderate and 0.94 for severe stenosis in the LAD. For the RCA, the AUROC was 0.92 for both moderate and severe stenosis detection. The LCX achieved an AUROC of 0.88 for the detection of moderate stenoses, though the calibration curve exhibited significant overestimation. Calibration curves matched probabilities for the LAD but showed discrepancies for the RCA. Heatmap visualisations confirmed the models' precision in delineating stenotic lesions. Decision curve analysis and net reclassification index assessments reinforced the efficacy of EfficientNet models, confirming their superior diagnostic capabilities. CONCLUSION: Our end-to-end deep-learning model demonstrates, for the LAD artery, excellent discriminatory ability and calibration during internal validation, despite a small dataset used to train the network. The model reliably produces precise, highly interpretable images.;['Gupta V', 'Petursson P', 'Rawshani A', 'Boren J', 'Ramunddal T', 'Bhatt DL', 'Omerovic E', 'Angeras O', 'Smith G', 'Sattar N', 'Andersson E', 'Redfors B', 'Hilgendorf L', 'Bergstrom G', 'Pirazzi C', 'Skoglund K', 'Rawshani A'];Open heart;2025 Jan 11;Rawshani
39477343;ECG;ACS detection;Predicting troponin biomarker elevation from electrocardiograms using a deep neural network.;BACKGROUND: Elevated troponin levels are a sensitive biomarker for cardiac injury. The quick and reliable prediction of troponin elevation for patients with chest pain from readily available ECGs may pose a valuable time-saving diagnostic tool during decision-making concerning this patient population. METHODS AND RESULTS: The data used included 15 856 ECGs from patients presenting to the emergency rooms with chest pain or dyspnoea at two centres in Sweden from 2015 to June 2023. All patients had high-sensitivity troponin test results within 6 hours after 12-lead ECG. Both troponin I (TnI) and TnT were used, with biomarker-specific cut-offs and sex-specific cut-offs for TnI. On this dataset, a residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) was trained 10 times, each on a unique split of the data. The final model achieved an average area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.7717 (95% CI+/-0.0052), calibration curve analysis revealed a mean slope of 1.243 (95% CI+/-0.075) and intercept of -0.073 (95% CI+/-0.034), indicating a good correlation between prediction and ground truth. Post-classification, tuned for F1 score, accuracy was 71.43% (95% CI+/-1.28), with an F1 score of 0.5642 (95% CI+/-0.0052) and a negative predictive value of 0.8660 (95% CI+/-0.0048), respectively. The ResNet displayed comparable or surpassing metrics to prior presented models. CONCLUSION: The model exhibited clinically meaningful performance, notably its high negative predictive accuracy. Therefore, clinical use of comparable neural networks in first-line, quick-response triage of patients with chest pain or dyspnoea appears as a valuable option in future medical practice.;['Hilgendorf L', 'Petursson P', 'Gupta V', 'Ramunddal T', 'Andersson E', 'Lundgren P', 'Dworeck C', 'Ljungman C', 'Boren J', 'Rawshani A', 'Omerovic E', 'Smith G', 'Mandalenakis Z', 'Skoglund K', 'Rawshani A'];Open heart;2024 Oct 30;Rawshani
39449961;Echo;Strain imaging;Deep learning improves test-retest reproducibility of regional strain in echocardiography.;AIMS: The clinical utility of regional strain measurements in echocardiography is challenged by suboptimal reproducibility. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the test-retest reproducibility of regional longitudinal strain (RLS) per coronary artery perfusion territory (RLS(Territory)) and basal-to-apical level of the left ventricle (RLS(Level)), measured by a novel fully automated deep learning (DL) method based on point tracking. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured strain in a dual-centre test-retest data set that included 40 controls and 40 patients with suspected non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. Two consecutive echocardiograms per subject were recorded by different operators. The reproducibility of RLS(Territory) and RLS(Level) measured by the DL method and by three experienced observers using semi-automatic software (2D Strain, EchoPAC, GE HealthCare) was evaluated as minimal detectable change (MDC). The DL method had MDC for RLS(Territory) and RLS(Level) ranging from 3.6 to 4.3%, corresponding to a 33-35% improved reproducibility compared with the inter- and intraobserver scenarios (MDC 5.5-6.4% and 4.9-5.4%). Furthermore, the DL method had a lower variance of test-retest differences for both RLS(Territory) and RLS(Level) compared with inter- and intraobserver scenarios (all P < 0.001). Bland-Altman analyses demonstrated superior reproducibility by the DL method for the whole range of strain values compared with the best observer scenarios. The feasibility of the DL method was 93% and measurement time was only 1 s per echocardiogram. CONCLUSION: The novel DL method provided fully automated measurements of RLS, with improved test-retest reproducibility compared with semi-automatic measurements by experienced observers. RLS measured by the DL method has the potential to advance patient care through a more detailed, more efficient, and less user-dependent clinical assessment of myocardial function.;['Nyberg J', 'Ostvik A', 'Salte IM', 'Olaisen S', 'Karlsen S', 'Dahlslett T', 'Smistad E', 'Eriksen-Volnes T', 'Brunvand H', 'Edvardsen T', 'Haugaa KH', 'Lovstakken L', 'Dalen H', 'Grenne B'];European heart journal.

39293786;MRI;Plaque detection;Image navigator-based, automated coronary magnetic resonance angiography for the detection of coronary artery stenosis.;"BACKGROUND: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is recommended as the first-line diagnostic imaging modality in low-to-intermediate-risk individuals suspected of stable coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CCTA exposes patients to ionizing radiation and potentially nephrotoxic contrast agents. Invasive coronary angiography is the gold-standard investigation to guide coronary revascularisation strategy; however, invasive procedures incur an inherent risk to the patient. Coronary magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA) avoids these issues. Nevertheless, clinical implementation is currently limited due to extended scanning durations, inconsistent image quality, and consequent lack of diagnostic accuracy. Several technical CMRA innovations, including advanced respiratory motion correction with 100% scan efficiency (no data rejection), fast image acquisition with motion-corrected undersampled image reconstruction, and deep-learning-based automated planning, have been implemented and now await clinical validation in multi-center trials. METHODS: The objective of the image navigator-based, automated CMRA prospective multi-center study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a newly developed, state-of-the-art, standardized, and automated CMRA framework compared to CCTA in 201 patients undergoing clinical investigation for CAD. The study protocol mandates the administration of oral beta-blockers to decrease heart rate to below 60 bpm and the use of sublingual nitroglycerine spray to induce vasodilation. Additionally, the study incorporates the utilization of standardized postprocessing with sliding-thin-slab multiplanar reformatting, in combination with evaluation of the source images, to optimize the visualization of coronary artery stenosis. DISCUSSION: If proven effective, CMRA could provide a non-invasive, needle-free, yet also clinically viable, alternative to CCTA.

39142467;Clinical data;Survival model;Prediction of neurologic outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: An interpretable approach with machine learning.;Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a critical condition with low survival rates. In patients with a return of spontaneous circulation, brain injury is a leading cause of death. In this study, we propose an interpretable machine learning approach for predicting neurologic outcome after OHCA, using information available at the time of hospital admission. METHODS: The study population were 55 615 OHCA cases registered in the Swedish Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Registry between 2010 and 2020. The dataset was split to training and validation sets (for model development) and test set (for evaluation of the final model). We used an XGBoost algorithm with stratified, repeated 10-fold cross-validation along with Optuna framework for hyperparameters tuning. The final model was trained on 10 features selected based on the importance scores and evaluated on the test set in terms of discrimination, calibration and bias-variance tradeoff. We used SHapley Additive exPlanations to address the 'black-box' model and align with eXplainable artificial intelligence. RESULTS: The final model achieved: area under the receiver operating characteristic value 0.964 (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.960-0.968]), sensitivity 0.606 (95% CI [0.573-0.634]), specificity 0.975 (95% CI [0.972-0.978]), positive predictive value (PPV) 0.664 (95% CI [0.625-0.696]), negative predictive value (NPV) 0.969 (95% CI [0.966-0.972]), macro F1 0.803 (95% CI [0.788-0.816]), and showed a very good calibration. SHAP features with the highest impact on the model's output were:'ROSC on arrival to hospital', 'Initial rhythm asystole' and 'Conscious on arrival to hospital'. CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost machine learning model with 10 features available at the time of hospital admission showed good performance for predicting neurologic outcome after OHCA, with no apparent signs of overfitting.;['Rawshani A', 'Hessulf F', 'Deminger J', 'Sultanian P', 'Gupta V', 'Lundgren P', 'Mohammed M', 'Abu Alchay M', 'Sioland T', 'Gryska E', 'Piasecki A'];Resuscitation;2024 Sep;Rawshani
39122609;Echo;MR quantification;EasyPISA: Automatic Integrated PISA Measurements of Mitral Regurgitation From 2-D Color-Doppler Using Deep Learning.;OBJECTIVE: The proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method is a well-established approach for mitral regurgitation (MR) quantification. However, it exhibits high inter-observer variability and inaccuracies in cases of non-hemispherical flow convergence and non-holosystolic MR. To address this, we present EasyPISA, a framework for automated integrated PISA measurements taken directly from 2-D color-Doppler sequences. METHODS: We trained convolutional neural networks (UNet/Attention UNet) on 1171 images from 196 recordings (54 patients) to detect and segment flow convergence zones in 2-D color-Doppler images. Different preprocessing schemes and model architectures were compared. Flow convergence surface areas were estimated, accounting for non-hemispherical convergence, and regurgitant volume (RVol) was computed by integrating the flow rate over time. EasyPISA was retrospectively applied to 26 MR patient examinations, comparing results with reference PISA RVol measurements, severity grades, and cMRI RVol measurements for 13 patients. RESULTS: The UNet trained on duplex images achieved the best results (precision: 0.63, recall: 0.95, dice: 0.58, flow rate error: 10.4 ml/s). Mitigation of false-positive segmentation on the atrial side of the mitral valve was achieved through integration with a mitral valve segmentation network. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.83 between EasyPISA and PISA, and 0.66 between EasyPISA and cMRI. Relative standard deviations were 46% and 53%, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics demonstrated a mean area under the curve between 0.90 and 0.97 for EasyPISA RVol estimates and reference severity grades. CONCLUSION: EasyPISA demonstrates promising results for fully automated integrated PISA measurements in MR, offering potential benefits in workload reduction and mitigating inter-observer variability in MR assessment.;['Wifstad SV', 'Kildahl HA', 'Holte E', 'Berg EAR', 'Grenne B', 'Salvesen O', 'Dalen H', 'Lovstakken L'];Ultrasound in medicine & biology;2024 Nov;Grenne
39044786;Echo;Ventricular function;Fully automatic estimation of global left ventricular systolic function using deep learning in transoesophageal echocardiography.;AIMS: To improve monitoring of cardiac function during major surgery and intensive care, we have developed a method for fully automatic estimation of mitral annular plane systolic excursion (auto-MAPSE) using deep learning in transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). The aim of this study was a clinical validation of auto-MAPSE in patients with heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: TOE recordings were collected from 185 consecutive patients without selection on image quality. Deep-learning-based auto-MAPSE was trained and optimized from 105 patient recordings. We assessed auto-MAPSE feasibility, and agreement and inter-rater reliability with manual reference in 80 patients with and without electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings. Mean processing time for auto-MAPSE was 0.3 s per cardiac cycle/view. Overall feasibility was >90% for manual MAPSE and ECG-enabled auto-MAPSE and 82% for ECG-disabled auto-MAPSE. Feasibility in at least two walls was >/=95% for all methods. Compared with manual reference, bias [95% limits of agreement (LoA)] was -0.5 [-4.0, 3.1] mm for ECG-enabled auto-MAPSE and -0.2 [-4.2, 3.6] mm for ECG-disabled auto-MAPSE. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for consistency was 0.90 and 0.88, respectively. Manual inter-observer bias [95% LoA] was -0.9 [-4.7, 3.0] mm, and ICC was 0.86. CONCLUSION: Auto-MAPSE was fast and highly feasible. Inter-rater reliability between auto-MAPSE and manual reference was good. Agreement between auto-MAPSE and manual reference did not differ from manual inter-observer agreement. As the principal advantages of deep-learning-based assessment are speed and reproducibility, auto-MAPSE has the potential to improve real-time monitoring of left ventricular function. This should be investigated in relevant clinical settings.;['Berg EAR', 'Tasken AA', 'Nordal T', 'Grenne B', 'Espeland T', 'Kirkeby-Garstad I', 'Dalen H', 'Holte E', 'Stolen S', 'Aakhus S', 'Kiss G'];European heart journal.

39034628;Clinical data;Survival model;ICURE: Intensive care unit (ICU) risk evaluation for 30-day mortality. Developing and evaluating a multivariable machine learning prediction model for patients admitted to the general ICU in Sweden.;BACKGROUND: A prediction model that estimates mortality at admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is of potential benefit to both patients and society. Logistic regression models like Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3) and APACHE are the traditional ICU mortality prediction models. With the emergence of machine learning (machine learning) and artificial intelligence, new possibilities arise to create prediction models that have the potential to sharpen predictive accuracy and reduce the likelihood of misclassification in the prediction of 30-day mortality. METHODS: We used the Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR) to identify and include all patients >/=18 years of age admitted to general ICUs in Sweden from 2008 to 2022 with SAPS 3 score registered. Only data collected within 1 h of ICU admission was used. We had 153 candidate predictors including baseline characteristics, previous medical conditions, blood works, physiological parameters, cause of admission, and initial treatment. We stratified the data randomly on the outcome variable 30-day mortality and created a training set (80% of data) and a test set (20% of data). We evaluated several hundred prediction models using multiple ML frameworks including random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks, and logistic regression models. Model performance was evaluated by comparing the receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (AUC-ROC). The best performing model was fine-tuned by optimizing hyperparameters. The model's calibration was evaluated by a calibration belt. Ultimately, we simplified the best performing model with the top 1-20 predictors. RESULTS: We included 296,344 first-time ICU admissions. We found age, Glasgow Coma Scale, creatinine, systolic blood pressure, and pH being the most important predictors. The AUC-ROC was 0.884 in test data using all predictors, specificity 95.2%, sensitivity 47.0%, negative predictive value of 87.9% and positive predictive value of 70.7%. The final model showed excellent calibration. The ICU risk evaluation for 30-day mortality (ICURE) prediction model performed equally well to the SAPS 3 score with only eight variables and improved further with the addition of more variables. CONCLUSION: The ICURE prediction model predicts 30-day mortality rate at first-time ICU admission superiorly compared to the established SAPS 3 score.;['Sioland T', 'Rawshani A', 'Nellgard B', 'Malmgren J', 'Oras J', 'Dalla K', 'Cina G', 'Engerstrom L', 'Hessulf F'];Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica;2024 Nov;Rawshani
39004698;Clinical data;Survival model;Importance of hospital and clinical factors for early mortality in Takotsubo syndrome: Insights from the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry.;BACKGROUND: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is an acute heart failure syndrome with symptoms similar to acute myocardial infarction. TTS is often triggered by acute emotional or physical stress and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Predictors of mortality in patients with TS are not well understood, and there is a need to identify high-risk patients and tailor treatment accordingly. This study aimed to assess the importance of various clinical factors in predicting 30-day mortality in TTS patients using a machine learning algorithm. METHODS: We analyzed data from the nationwide Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR) for all patients with TTS in Sweden between 2015 and 2022. Gradient boosting was used to assess the relative importance of variables in predicting 30-day mortality in TTS patients. RESULTS: Of 3,180 patients hospitalized with TTS, 76.0% were women. The median age was 71.0 years (interquartile range 62-77). The crude all-cause mortality rate was 3.2% at 30 days. Machine learning algorithms by gradient boosting identified treating hospitals as the most important predictor of 30-day mortality. This factor was followed in significance by the clinical indication for angiography, creatinine level, Killip class, and age. Other less important factors included weight, height, and certain medical conditions such as hyperlipidemia and smoking status. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning with gradient boosting, we analyzed all Swedish patients diagnosed with TTS over seven years and found that the treating hospital was the most significant predictor of 30-day mortality.;['Gudmundsson T', 'Redfors B', 'Ramunddal T', 'Angeras O', 'Petursson P', 'Rawshani A', 'Hagstrom H', 'Alfredsson J', 'Ekenback C', 'Henareh L', 'Skoglund K', 'Ljungman C', 'Mohammad M', 'Jernberg T', 'Frobert O', 'Erlinge D', 'Omerovic E'];BMC cardiovascular disorders;2024 Jul 15;Rawshani
38992934;Clinical data;Survival model;Aetiology and predictors of outcome in non-shockable in-hospital cardiac arrest: A retrospective cohort study from the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.;"BACKGROUND: Non-shockable in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a condition with diverse aetiology, predictive factors, and outcome. This study aimed to compare IHCA with initial asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA), focusing specifically on their aetiologies and the significance of predictive factors. METHODS: Using the Swedish Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, adult non-shockable IHCA cases from 2018 to 2022 (n = 5788) were analysed. Exposure was initial rhythm, while survival to hospital discharge was the primary outcome. A random forest model with 28 variables was used to generate permutation-based variable importance for outcome prediction. RESULTS: Overall, 60% of patients (n = 3486) were male and the median age was 75 years (IQR 67-81). The most frequent arrest location (46%) was on general wards. Comorbidities were present in 79% of cases and the most prevalent comorbidity was heart failure (33%). Initial rhythm was PEA in 47% (n = 2702) of patients, and asystole in 53% (n = 3086). The most frequent aetiologies in both PEA and asystole were cardiac ischemia (24% vs. 19%, absolute difference [AD]: 5.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0% to 7.7%), and respiratory failure (14% vs. 13%, no significant difference). Survival was higher in asystole (24%) than in PEA (17%) (AD: 7.3%; 95% CI 5.2% to 9.4%). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) durations were longer in PEA, 18 vs 15 min (AD 4.9 min, 95% CI 4.0-5.9 min). The duration of CPR was the single most important predictor of survival across all subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Aetiology ranked as the second most important predictor in most analyses, except in the asystole subgroup where responsiveness at cardiac arrest team arrival took precedence. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide registry study of non-shockable IHCA comparing asystole to PEA, cardiac ischemia and respiratory failure were the predominant aetiologies. Duration of CPR was the most important predictor of survival, followed by aetiology. Asystole was associated with higher survival compared to PEA, possibly due to shorter CPR durations and a larger proportion of reversible aetiologies.";['Bruchfeld S', 'Ullemark E', 'Riva G', 'Ohm J', 'Rawshani A', 'Djarv T'];Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica;2024 Nov;Rawshani
38856861;Echo;Ventricular function;Continuous monitoring of left ventricular function in postoperative intensive care patients using artificial intelligence and transesophageal echocardiography.;BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring of mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may improve the evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function in postoperative intensive care patients. We aimed to assess the utility of continuous monitoring of LV function using TEE and artificial intelligence (autoMAPSE) in postoperative intensive care patients. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we monitored 50 postoperative intensive care patients for 120 min immediately after cardiac surgery. We recorded a set of two-chamber and four-chamber TEE images every five minutes. We defined monitoring feasibility as how often the same wall from the same patient could be reassessed, and categorized monitoring feasibility as excellent if the same LV wall could be reassessed in >/= 90% of the total recordings. To compare autoMAPSE with manual measurements, we rapidly recorded three sets of repeated images to assess precision (least significant change), bias, and limits of agreement (LOA). To assess the ability to identify changes (trending ability), we compared changes in autoMAPSE with the changes in manual measurements in images obtained during the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass as well as before and after surgery. RESULTS: Monitoring feasibility was excellent in most patients (88%). Compared with manual measurements, autoMAPSE was more precise (least significant change 2.2 vs 3.1 mm, P < 0.001), had low bias (0.4 mm), and acceptable agreement (LOA - 2.7 to 3.5 mm). AutoMAPSE had excellent trending ability, as its measurements changed in the same direction as manual measurements (concordance rate 96%). CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring of LV function was feasible using autoMAPSE. Compared with manual measurements, autoMAPSE had excellent trending ability, low bias, acceptable agreement, and was more precise.;['Yu J', 'Tasken AA', 'Berg EAR', 'Tannvik TD', 'Slagsvold KH', 'Kirkeby-Garstad I', 'Grenne B', 'Kiss G', 'Aakhus S'];Intensive care medicine experimental;2024 Jun 10;Grenne

38774371;Clinical data;Survival model;Prediction of survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: the updated Swedish cardiac arrest risk score (SCARS) model.;AIMS: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major health concern worldwide. Although one-third of all patients achieve a return of spontaneous circulation and may undergo a difficult period in the intensive care unit, only 1 in 10 survive. This study aims to improve our previously developed machine learning model for early prognostication of survival in OHCA. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied all cases registered in the Swedish Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Registry during 2010 and 2020 (n = 55 615). We compared the predictive performance of extreme gradient boosting (XGB), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), logistic regression, CatBoost, random forest, and TabNet. For each framework, we developed models that optimized (i) a weighted F1 score to penalize models that yielded more false negatives and (ii) a precision-recall area under the curve (PR AUC). LightGBM assigned higher importance values to a larger set of variables, while XGB made predictions using fewer predictors. The area under the curve receiver operating characteristic (AUC ROC) scores for LightGBM were 0.958 (optimized for weighted F1) and 0.961 (optimized for a PR AUC), while for XGB, the scores were 0.958 and 0.960, respectively. The calibration plots showed a subtle underestimation of survival for LightGBM, contrasting with a mild overestimation for XGB models. In the crucial range of 0-10% likelihood of survival, the XGB model, optimized with the PR AUC, emerged as a clinically safe model. CONCLUSION: We improved our previous prediction model by creating a parsimonious model with an AUC ROC at 0.96, with excellent calibration and no apparent risk of underestimating survival in the critical probability range (0-10%).

38485534;Echo;Ventricular function;Automatic Detection and Tracking of Anatomical Landmarks in Transesophageal Echocardiography for Quantification of Left Ventricular Function.;OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function in critical care patients is useful for guidance of therapy and early detection of LV dysfunction, but the tools currently available are too time-consuming. To resolve this issue, we previously proposed a method for the continuous and automatic quantification of global LV function in critical care patients based on the detection and tracking of anatomical landmarks on transesophageal heart ultrasound. In the present study, our aim was to improve the performance of mitral annulus detection in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). METHODS: We investigated several state-of-the-art networks for both the detection and tracking of the mitral annulus in TEE. We integrated the networks into a pipeline for automatic assessment of LV function through estimation of the mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE), called autoMAPSE. TEE recordings from a total of 245 patients were collected from St. Olav's University Hospital and used to train and test the respective networks. We evaluated the agreement between autoMAPSE estimates and manual references annotated by expert echocardiographers in 30 Echolab patients and 50 critical care patients. Furthermore, we proposed a prototype of autoMAPSE for clinical integration and tested it in critical care patients in the intensive care unit. RESULTS: Compared with manual references, we achieved a mean difference of 0.8 (95% limits of agreement: -2.9 to 4.7) mm in Echolab patients, with a feasibility of 85.7%. In critical care patients, we reached a mean difference of 0.6 (95% limits of agreement: -2.3 to 3.5) mm and a feasibility of 88.1%. The clinical prototype of autoMAPSE achieved real-time performance. CONCLUSION: Automatic quantification of LV function had high feasibility in clinical settings. The agreement with manual references was comparable to inter-observer variability of clinical experts.;['Tasken AA', 'Yu J', 'Berg EAR', 'Grenne B', 'Holte E', 'Dalen H', 'Stolen S', 'Lindseth F', 'Aakhus S', 'Kiss G'];Ultrasound in medicine & biology;2024 Jun;Grenne
38442058;Echo;Valvular function;Cardiac Valve Event Timing in Echocardiography Using Deep Learning and Triplane Recordings.;Cardiac valve event timing plays a crucial role when conducting clinical measurements using echocardiography. However, established automated approaches are limited by the need of external electrocardiogram sensors, and manual measurements often rely on timing from different cardiac cycles. Recent methods have applied deep learning to cardiac timing, but they have mainly been restricted to only detecting two key time points, namely end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES). In this work, we propose a deep learning approach that leverages triplane recordings to enhance detection of valve events in echocardiography. Our method demonstrates improved performance detecting six different events, including valve events conventionally associated with ED and ES. Of all events, we achieve an average absolute frame difference (aFD) of maximum 1.4 frames (29 ms) for start of diastasis, down to 0.6 frames (12 ms) for mitral valve opening when performing a ten-fold cross-validation with test splits on triplane data from 240 patients. On an external independent test consisting of apical long-axis data from 180 other patients, the worst performing event detection had an aFD of 1.8 (30 ms). The proposed approach has the potential to significantly impact clinical practice by enabling more accurate, rapid and comprehensive event detection, leading to improved clinical measurements.;['Fermann BS', 'Nyberg J', 'Remme EW', 'Grue JF', 'Grue H', 'Haland R', 'Lovstakken L', 'Dalen H', 'Grenne B', 'Aase SA', 'Snare SR', 'Ostvik A'];IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics;2024 May;Grenne
38341361;Echo;Valvular function;Mitral Valve Segmentation and Tracking from Transthoracic Echocardiography Using Deep Learning.;OBJECTIVE: Valvular heart diseases (VHDs) pose a significant public health burden, and deciding the best treatment strategy necessitates accurate assessment of heart valve function. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the key modality to evaluate VHDs, but the lack of standardized quantitative measurements leads to subjective and time-consuming assessments. We aimed to use deep learning to automate the extraction of mitral valve (MV) leaflets and annular hinge points from echocardiograms of the MV, improving standardization and reducing workload in quantitative assessment of MV disease. METHODS: We annotated the MV leaflets and annulus points in 2931 images from 127 patients. We propose an approach for segmenting the annotated features using Attention UNet with deep supervision and weight scheduling of the attention coefficients to enforce saliency surrounding the MV. The derived segmentation masks were used to extract quantitative biomarkers for specific MV leaflet scallops throughout the heart cycle. RESULTS: Evaluation performance was summarized using a Dice score of 0.63 +/- 0.14, annulus error of 3.64 +/- 2.53 and leaflet angle error of 8.7 +/- 8.3 degrees . Leveraging Attention UNet with deep supervision robustness of clinically relevant metrics was improved compared with UNet, reducing standard deviations by 2.7 degrees  (angle error) and 0.73 mm (annulus error). We correctly identified cases of MV prolapse, cases of stenosis and healthy references from a clinical material using the derived biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Robust deep learning segmentation and tracking of MV morphology and motion is possible by leveraging attention gates and deep supervision, and holds promise for enhancing VHD diagnosis and treatment monitoring.;['Wifstad SV', 'Kildahl HA', 'Grenne B', 'Holte E', 'Hauge SW', 'Saebo S', 'Mekonnen D', 'Nega B', 'Haaverstad R', 'Estensen ME', 'Dalen H', 'Lovstakken L'];Ultrasound in medicine & biology;2024 May;Grenne
38309758;Clinical data;Survival model;Early ICD implantation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a retrospective cohort study from the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.;"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is generally beneficial in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). OBJECTIVE: We studied the association between ICD implantation prior to discharge and survival in patients with cardiac aetiology or initial shockable rhythm in OHCA. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. Treatment associations were estimated using propensity scores. We used gradient boosting, Bayesian additive regression trees, neural networks, extreme gradient boosting and logistic regression to generate multiple propensity scores. We selected the model yielding maximum covariate balance to obtain weights, which were used in a Cox regression to calculate HRs for death or recurrent cardiac arrest. PARTICIPANTS: All cases discharged alive during 2010 to 2020 with a cardiac aetiology or initial shockable rhythm were included. A total of 959 individuals were discharged with an ICD, and 2046 were discharged without one. RESULTS: Among those experiencing events, 25% did so within 90 days in the ICD group, compared with 52% in the other group. All HRs favoured ICD implantation. The overall HR (95% CI) for ICD versus no ICD was 0.38 (0.26 to 0.56). The HR was 0.42 (0.28 to 0.63) in cases with initial shockable rhythm; 0.18 (0.06 to 0.58) in non-shockable rhythm; 0.32 (0.20 to 0.53) in cases with a history of coronary artery disease; 0.36 (0.22 to 0.61) in heart failure and 0.30 (0.13 to 0.69) in those with diabetes. Similar associations were noted in all subgroups. CONCLUSION: Among survivors of OHCA, those discharged with an ICD had approximately 60% lower risk of death or recurrent cardiac arrest. A randomised trial is warranted to study this further.";['Sultanian P', 'Lundgren P', 'Rawshani A', 'Moller S', 'Jafari AH', 'David L', 'Yassinson S', 'Myredal A', 'Rorsman C', 'Taha A', 'Ravn-Fischer A', 'Martinsson A', 'Herlitz J', 'Rawshani A'];BMJ open;2024 Feb 2;Rawshani
38290912;Echo;Ventricular function;Automated Segmentation and Quantification of the Right Ventricle in 2-D Echocardiography.;OBJECTIVE: The right ventricle receives less attention than its left counterpart in echocardiography research, practice and development of automated solutions. In the work described here, we sought to determine that the deep learning methods for automated segmentation of the left ventricle in 2-D echocardiograms are also valid for the right ventricle. Additionally, here we describe and explore a keypoint detection approach to segmentation that guards against erratic behavior often displayed by segmentation models. METHODS: We used a data set of echo images focused on the right ventricle from 250 participants to train and evaluate several deep learning models for segmentation and keypoint detection. We propose a compact architecture (U-Net KP) employing the latter approach. The architecture is designed to balance high speed with accuracy and robustness. RESULTS: All featured models achieved segmentation accuracy close to the inter-observer variability. When computing the metrics of right ventricular systolic function from contour predictions of U-Net KP, we obtained the bias and 95% limits of agreement of 0.8 +/- 10.8% for the right ventricular fractional area change measurements, -0.04 +/- 0.54 cm for the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion measurements and 0.2 +/- 6.6% for the right ventricular free wall strain measurements. These results were also comparable to the semi-automatically derived inter-observer discrepancies of 0.4 +/- 11.8%, -0.37 +/- 0.58 cm and -1.0 +/- 7.7% for the aforementioned metrics, respectively. CONCLUSION: Given the appropriate data, automated segmentation and quantification of the right ventricle in 2-D echocardiography are feasible with existing methods. However, keypoint detection architectures may offer higher robustness and information density for the same computational cost.;['Chernyshov A', 'Grue JF', 'Nyberg J', 'Grenne B', 'Dalen H', 'Aase SA', 'Ostvik A', 'Lovstakken L'];Ultrasound in medicine & biology;2024 Apr;Grenne
38267466;Clinical data;Survival model;Identifying top ten predictors of type 2 diabetes through machine learning analysis of UK Biobank data.;The study aimed to identify the most predictive factors for the development of type 2 diabetes. Using an XGboost classification model, we projected type 2 diabetes incidence over a 10-year horizon. We deliberately minimized the selection of baseline factors to fully exploit the rich dataset from the UK Biobank. The predictive value of features was assessed using shap values, with model performance evaluated via Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Data from the UK Biobank, encompassing a vast population with comprehensive demographic and health data, was employed. The study enrolled 450,000 participants aged 40-69, excluding those with pre-existing diabetes. Among 448,277 participants, 12,148 developed type 2 diabetes within a decade. HbA1c emerged as the foremost predictor, followed by BMI, waist circumference, blood glucose, family history of diabetes, gamma-glutamyl transferase, waist-hip ratio, HDL cholesterol, age, and urate. Our XGboost model achieved a Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve of 0.9 for 10-year type 2 diabetes prediction, with a reduced 10-feature model achieving 0.88. Easily measurable biological factors surpassed traditional risk factors like diet, physical activity, and socioeconomic status in predicting type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, high prediction accuracy could be maintained using just the top 10 biological factors, with additional ones offering marginal improvements. These findings underscore the significance of biological markers in type 2 diabetes prediction.;['Lugner M', 'Rawshani A', 'Helleryd E', 'Eliasson B'];Scientific reports;2024 Jan 24;Rawshani
37883712;Echo;Ventricular function;Automatic measurements of left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction by artificial intelligence: clinical validation in real time and large databases.;AIMS: Echocardiography is a cornerstone in cardiac imaging, and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a key parameter for patient management. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled fully automatic measurements of LV volumes and EF both during scanning and in stored recordings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of implementing AI measurements on acquisition and processing time and test-retest reproducibility compared with standard clinical workflow, as well as to study the agreement with reference in large internal and external databases. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fully automatic measurements of LV volumes and EF by a novel AI software were compared with manual measurements in the following clinical scenarios: (i) in real time use during scanning of 50 consecutive patients, (ii) in 40 subjects with repeated echocardiographic examinations and manual measurements by 4 readers, and (iii) in large internal and external research databases of 1881 and 849 subjects, respectively. Real-time AI measurements significantly reduced the total acquisition and processing time by 77% (median 5.3 min, P < 0.001) compared with standard clinical workflow. Test-retest reproducibility of AI measurements was superior in inter-observer scenarios and non-inferior in intra-observer scenarios. AI measurements showed good agreement with reference measurements both in real time and in large research databases. CONCLUSION: The software reduced the time taken to perform and volumetrically analyse routine echocardiograms without a decrease in accuracy compared with experts.;['Olaisen S', 'Smistad E', 'Espeland T', 'Hu J', 'Pasdeloup D', 'Ostvik A', 'Aakhus S', 'Rosner A', 'Malm S', 'Stylidis M', 'Holte E', 'Grenne B', 'Lovstakken L', 'Dalen H'];European heart journal.

37783546;Echo;Valvular function;Automated estimation of mitral annular plane systolic excursion by artificial intelligence from 3D ultrasound recordings.;Perioperative monitoring of cardiac function is beneficial for early detection of cardiovascular complications. The standard of care for cardiac monitoring performed by trained cardiologists and anesthesiologists involves a manual and qualitative evaluation of ultrasound imaging, which is a time-demanding and resource-intensive process with intraobserver- and interobserver variability. In practice, such measures can only be performed a limited number of times during the intervention. To overcome these difficulties, this study presents a robust method for automatic and quantitative monitoring of cardiac function based on 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) B-mode ultrasound recordings of the left ventricle (LV). Such an assessment obtains consistent measurements and can produce a near real-time evaluation of ultrasound imagery. Hence, the presented method is time-saving and results in increased accessibility. The mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE), characterizing global LV function, is estimated by landmark detection and cardiac view classification of two-dimensional images extracted along the long-axis of the ultrasound volume. MAPSE estimation directly from 3D TEE recordings is beneficial since it removes the need for manual acquisition of cardiac views, hence decreasing the need for interference by physicians. Two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained and tested on acquired ultrasound data of 107 patients, and MAPSE estimates were compared to clinically obtained references in a blinded study including 31 patients. The proposed method for automatic MAPSE estimation had low bias and low variability in comparison to clinical reference measures. The method accomplished a mean difference for MAPSE estimates of (-0.16+/-1.06) mm. Thus, the results did not show significant systematic errors. The obtained bias and variance of the method were comparable to inter-observer variability of clinically obtained MAPSE measures on 2D TTE echocardiography. The novel pipeline proposed in this study has the potential to enhance cardiac monitoring in perioperative- and intensive care settings.;['Tasken AA', 'Berg EAR', 'Grenne B', 'Holte E', 'Dalen H', 'Stolen S', 'Lindseth F', 'Aakhus S', 'Kiss G'];Artificial intelligence in medicine;2023 Oct;Grenne
37489729;Clinical data;Survival model;Clinical Outcomes and Predictors of Long-Term Survival in Patients With and Without Previously Known Extracardiac Sarcoidosis Using Machine Learning: A Swedish Multicenter Study.;Background Cardiac involvement can be an initial manifestation in sarcoidosis. However, little is known about the association between various clinical phenotypes of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) and outcomes. We aimed to analyze the relation of different clinical manifestations with outcomes of CS and to investigate the relative importance of clinical features influencing overall survival. Methods and Results A retrospective cohort of 141 patients with CS enrolled at 2 Swedish university hospitals was studied. Presentation, imaging studies, and outcomes of de novo CS and previously known extracardiac sarcoidosis were compared. Survival free of primary composite outcome (ventricular arrhythmias, heart transplantation, or death) was assessed. Machine learning algorithm was used to study the relative importance of clinical features in predicting outcome. Sixty-two patients with de novo CS and 79 with previously known extracardiac sarcoidosis were included. De novo CS showed more advanced New York Heart Association class (P=0.02), higher circulating levels of NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) (P<0.001), and troponins (P<0.001), as well as a higher prevalence of right ventricular dysfunction (P<0.001). During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 61 (44-77) months, event-free survival was shorter in patients with de novo CS (P<0.001). The top 5 features predicting worse event-free survival in order of importance were as follows: impaired tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, de novo CS, reduced right ventricular ejection fraction, absence of beta-blockers, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. Conclusions Patients with de novo CS displayed more severe disease and worse outcomes compared with patients with previously known extracardiac sarcoidosis. Using machine learning, right ventricular dysfunction and de novo CS stand out as strong overall predictors of impaired survival.;['Bobbio E', 'Eldhagen P', 'Polte CL', 'Hjalmarsson C', 'Karason K', 'Rawshani A', 'Darlington P', 'Kullberg S', 'Sorensson P', 'Bergh N', 'Bollano E'];Journal of the American Heart Association;2023 Aug;Rawshani
36933849;Echo;Ventricular function;Deep Learning for Improved Precision and Reproducibility of Left Ventricular Strain in Echocardiography: A Test-Retest Study.;"AIMS: Assessment of left ventricular (LV) function by echocardiography is hampered by modest test-retest reproducibility. A novel artificial intelligence (AI) method based on deep learning provides fully automated measurements of LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) and may improve the clinical utility of echocardiography by reducing user-related variability. The aim of this study was to assess within-patient test-retest reproducibility of LV GLS measured by the novel AI method in repeated echocardiograms recorded by different echocardiographers and to compare the results to manual measurements. METHODS: Two test-retest data sets (n = 40 and n = 32) were obtained at separate centers. Repeated recordings were acquired in immediate succession by 2 different echocardiographers at each center. For each data set, 4 readers measured GLS in both recordings using a semiautomatic method to construct test-retest interreader and intrareader scenarios. Agreement, mean absolute difference, and minimal detectable change (MDC) were compared to analyses by AI. In a subset of 10 patients, beat-to-beat variability in 3 cardiac cycles was assessed by 2 readers and AI. RESULTS: Test-retest variability was lower with AI compared with interreader scenarios (data set I: MDC = 3.7 vs 5.5, mean absolute difference = 1.4 vs 2.1, respectively; data set II: MDC = 3.9 vs 5.2, mean absolute difference = 1.6 vs 1.9, respectively; all P < .05). There was bias in GLS measurements in 13 of 24 test-retest interreader scenarios (largest bias, 3.2 strain units). In contrast, there was no bias in measurements by AI. Beat-to-beat MDCs were 1,5, 2.1, and 2.3 for AI and the 2 readers, respectively. Processing time for analyses of GLS by the AI method was 7.9 +/- 2.8 seconds. CONCLUSION: A fast AI method for automated measurements of LV GLS reduced test-retest variability and removed bias between readers in both test-retest data sets. By improving the precision and reproducibility, AI may increase the clinical utility of echocardiography.";['Salte IM', 'Ostvik A', 'Olaisen SH', 'Karlsen S', 'Dahlslett T', 'Smistad E', 'Eriksen-Volnes TK', 'Brunvand H', 'Haugaa KH', 'Edvardsen T', 'Dalen H', 'Lovstakken L', 'Grenne B'];Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography;2023 Jul;Grenne
36773348;Clinical data;Survival model;Predicting survival and neurological outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using machine learning: the SCARS model.;"BACKGROUND: A prediction model that estimates survival and neurological outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients has the potential to improve clinical management in emergency rooms. METHODS: We used the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation to study all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) cases in Sweden from 2010 to 2020. We had 393 candidate predictors describing the circumstances at cardiac arrest, critical time intervals, patient demographics, initial presentation, spatiotemporal data, socioeconomic status, medications, and comorbidities before arrest. To develop, evaluate and test an array of prediction models, we created stratified (on the outcome measure) random samples of our study population. We created a training set (60% of data), evaluation set (20% of data), and test set (20% of data). We assessed the 30-day survival and cerebral performance category (CPC) score at discharge using several machine learning frameworks with hyperparameter tuning. Parsimonious models with the top 1 to 20 strongest predictors were tested. We calibrated the decision threshold to assess the cut-off yielding 95% sensitivity for survival. The final model was deployed as a web application. FINDINGS: We included 55,615 cases of OHCA. Initial presentation, prehospital interventions, and critical time intervals variables were the most important. At a sensitivity of 95%, specificity was 89%, positive predictive value 52%, and negative predictive value 99% in test data to predict 30-day survival. The area under the receiver characteristic curve was 0.97 in test data using all 393 predictors or only the ten most important predictors. The final model showed excellent calibration. The web application allowed for near-instantaneous survival calculations. INTERPRETATION: Thirty-day survival and neurological outcome in OHCA can rapidly and reliably be estimated during ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the emergency room using a machine learning model incorporating widely available variables.

36581182;Clinical data;Survival model;Predicting recurrent cardiac arrest in individuals surviving Out-of-Hospital cardiac arrest.;BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in short-term survival for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in the past two decades, long-term survival is still not well studied. Furthermore, the contribution of different variables on long-term survival have not been fully investigated. AIM: Examine the 1-year prognosis of patients discharged from hospital after an OHCA. Furthermore, identify factors predicting re-arrest and/or death during 1-year follow-up. METHODS: All patients 18 years or older surviving an OHCA and discharged from the hospital were identified from the Swedish Register for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (SRCR). Data on diagnoses, medications and socioeconomic factors was gathered from other Swedish registers. A machine learning model was constructed with 886 variables and evaluated for its predictive capabilities. Variable importance was gathered from the model and new models with the most important variables were created. RESULTS: Out of the 5098 patients included, 902 ( approximately 18%) suffered a recurrent cardiac arrest or death within a year. For the outcome death or re-arrest within 1 year from discharge the model achieved an ROC (receiver operating characteristics) AUC (area under the curve) of 0.73. A model with the 15 most important variables achieved an AUC of 0.69. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of an OHCA have a high risk of suffering a re-arrest or death within 1 year from hospital discharge. A machine learning model with 15 different variables, among which age, socioeconomic factors and neurofunctional status at hospital discharge, achieved almost the same predictive capabilities with reasonable precision as the full model with 886 variables.;['Hellsen G', 'Rawshani A', 'Skoglund K', 'Bergh N', 'Ramunddal T', 'Myredal A', 'Helleryd E', 'Taha A', 'Mahmoud A', 'Hjartstam N', 'Backelin C', 'Dahlberg P', 'Hessulf F', 'Herlitz J', 'Engdahl J', 'Rawshani A'];Resuscitation;2023 Mar;Rawshani
36315529;Echo;Valves;Quantifying Valve Regurgitation Using 3-D Doppler Ultrasound Images and Deep Learning.;Accurate quantification of cardiac valve regurgitation jets is fundamental for guiding treatment. Cardiac ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic tool, but current methods for measuring the regurgitant volume (RVol) are limited by low accuracy and high interobserver variability. Following recent research, quantitative estimators of orifice size and RVol based on high frame rate 3-D ultrasound have been proposed, but measurement accuracy is limited by the wide point spread function (PSF) relative to the orifice size. The aim of this article was to investigate the use of deep learning to estimate both the orifice size and the RVol. A simulation model was developed to simulate the power-Doppler images of blood flow through orifices with different geometries. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on 30 000 image pairs. The network was used to reconstruct orifices from power-Doppler data, which facilitated estimators for regurgitant orifice areas and flow volumes. We demonstrate that the network improves orifice shape reconstruction, as well as the accuracy of orifice area and flow volume estimation, compared with a previous approach based on thresholding of the power-Doppler signal (THD), and compared with spatially invariant deconvolution (DC). Our approach reduces the area estimation error on simulations: (THD: 13.2 +/- 9.9 mm2, DC: 12.8 +/- 15.8 mm2, and ours: 3.5 +/- 3.2 mm2). In a phantom experiment, our approach reduces both area estimation error (THD: 10.4 +/- 8.4 mm2, DC: 10.98 +/- 8.17, and ours: 9.9 +/- 6.0 mm2) and flow rate estimation error (THD: 20.3 +/- 9.9 ml/s, DC: 18.14 +/- 13.01 ml/s, and ours: 7.1 +/- 10.6 ml/s). We also demonstrate in vivo feasibility for six patients with aortic insufficiency, compared with standard echocardiography and magnetic resonance references.;['Wifstad SV', 'Lovstakken L', 'Avdal J', 'Berg EAR', 'Torp H', 'Grenne B', 'Fiorentini S'];IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control;2022 Dec;Grenne
36280443;Echo;Other;Real-Time Echocardiography Guidance for Optimized Apical Standard Views.;Measurements of cardiac function such as left ventricular ejection fraction and myocardial strain are typically based on 2-D ultrasound imaging. The reliability of these measurements depends on the correct pose of the transducer such that the 2-D imaging plane properly aligns with the heart for standard measurement views and is thus dependent on the operator's skills. We propose a deep learning tool that suggests transducer movements to help users navigate toward the required standard views while scanning. The tool can simplify echocardiography for less experienced users and improve image standardization for more experienced users. Training data were generated by slicing 3-D ultrasound volumes, which permits simulation of the movements of a 2-D transducer. Neural networks were further trained to calculate the transducer position in a regression fashion. The method was validated and tested on 2-D images from several data sets representative of a prospective clinical setting. The method proposed the adequate transducer movement 75% of the time when averaging over all degrees of freedom and 95% of the time when considering transducer rotation solely. Real-time application examples illustrate the direct relation between the transducer movements, the ultrasound image and the provided feedback.;['Pasdeloup D', 'Olaisen SH', 'Ostvik A', 'Sabo S', 'Pettersen HN', 'Holte E', 'Grenne B', 'Stolen SB', 'Smistad E', 'Aase SA', 'Dalen H', 'Lovstakken L'];Ultrasound in medicine & biology;2023 Jan;Grenne
36054515;Clinical data;Survival model;Optimizing an existing prediction model for quality of life one-year post-intensive care unit: An exploratory analysis.;BACKGROUND: This study aimed to improve the PREPARE model, an existing linear regression prediction model for long-term quality of life (QoL) of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors by incorporating additional ICU data from patients' electronic health record (EHR) and bedside monitors. METHODS: The 1308 adult ICU patients, aged >/=16, admitted between July 2016 and January 2019 were included. Several regression-based machine learning models were fitted on a combination of patient-reported data and expert-selected EHR variables and bedside monitor data to predict change in QoL 1 year after ICU admission. Predictive performance was compared to a five-feature linear regression prediction model using only 24-hour data (R(2)  = 0.54, mean square error (MSE) = 0.031, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.128). RESULTS: The 67.9% of the included ICU survivors was male and the median age was 65.0 [IQR: 57.0-71.0]. Median length of stay (LOS) was 1 day [IQR 1.0-2.0]. The incorporation of the additional data pertaining to the entire ICU stay did not improve the predictive performance of the original linear regression model. The best performing machine learning model used seven features (R(2)  = 0.52, MSE = 0.032, MAE = 0.125). Pre-ICU QoL, the presence of a cerebro vascular accident (CVA) upon admission and the highest temperature measured during the ICU stay were the most important contributors to predictive performance. Pre-ICU QoL's contribution to predictive performance far exceeded that of the other predictors. CONCLUSION: Pre-ICU QoL was by far the most important predictor for change in QoL 1 year after ICU admission. The incorporation of the numerous additional features pertaining to the entire ICU stay did not improve predictive performance although the patients' LOS was relatively short.;['de Jonge M', 'Wubben N', 'van Kaam CR', 'Frenzel T', 'Hoedemaekers CWE', 'Ambrogioni L', 'van der Hoeven JG', 'van den Boogaard M', 'Zegers M'];Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica;2022 Nov;Boogaard
35734307;Clinical data;Survival model;Association between type of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A machine learning study.;"AIM: In the event of an out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) it is recommended for a sole untrained bystander to perform compression only CPR (CO-CPR). However, it remains unknown if CO-CPR is inferior to standard CPR (S-CPR), including both compressions and ventilation, in terms of survival. One could speculate that due to the current pandemic, bystanders may be more hesitant performing mouth-to-mouth ventilation. The aim of this study is to assess the association between type of bystander CPR and survival in OHCA. METHODS: This study included all patients with a bystander treated OHCA between year 2015-2019 in ages 18-100 using The Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (SRCR). We compared CO-CPR to S-CPR in terms of 30-day survival using a propensity score approach based on machine learning adjusting for a large number of covariates. RESULTS: A total of 13,481 patients were included (5,293 with S-CPR and 8,188 with CO-CPR). The matched subgroup consisted of 2994 cases in each group.Gradient boosting were the best models with regards to predictive accuracy (for type of bystander CPR) and covariate balance. The difference between S-CPR and CO-CPR in all 30 models computed on covariate adjustment and 1-to-1 matching were non-significant. In the 30 weighted models, three comparisons (S-CPR vs. CO-CPR) were significant in terms of improved survival; odds ratio for men was 1.21 (99% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.43; Average treatment effect (ATE)); for patients >/=73 years 1.57 (99% CI 1.17-2.12) for Average treatment effect on treated (ATT) and 1.63 (99% CI 1.18-2.25) for ATE. Remaining 27 models showed no differences. No significances remain after adjustment for multiple testing.

34819872;Clinical data;Survival model;Combined In-silico and Machine Learning Approaches Toward Predicting Arrhythmic Risk in Post-infarction Patients.;"Background: Remodeling due to myocardial infarction (MI) significantly increases patient arrhythmic risk. Simulations using patient-specific models have shown promise in predicting personalized risk for arrhythmia. However, these are computationally- and time- intensive, hindering translation to clinical practice. Classical machine learning (ML) algorithms (such as K-nearest neighbors, Gaussian support vector machines, and decision trees) as well as neural network techniques, shown to increase prediction accuracy, can be used to predict occurrence of arrhythmia as predicted by simulations based solely on infarct and ventricular geometry. We present an initial combined image-based patient-specific in silico and machine learning methodology to assess risk for dangerous arrhythmia in post-infarct patients. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate that simulation-supported data augmentation improves prediction models, combining patient data, computational simulation, and advanced statistical modeling, improving overall accuracy for arrhythmia risk assessment. Methods: MRI-based computational models were constructed from 30 patients 5 days post-MI (the ""baseline"" population). In order to assess the utility biophysical model-supported data augmentation for improving arrhythmia prediction, we augmented the virtual baseline patient population. Each patient ventricular and ischemic geometry in the baseline population was used to create a subfamily of geometric models, resulting in an expanded set of patient models (the ""augmented"" population). Arrhythmia induction was attempted via programmed stimulation at 17 sites for each virtual patient corresponding to AHA LV segments and simulation outcome, ""arrhythmia,"" or ""no-arrhythmia,"" were used as ground truth for subsequent statistical prediction (machine learning, ML) models. For each patient geometric model, we measured and used choice data features: the myocardial volume and ischemic volume, as well as the segment-specific myocardial volume and ischemia percentage, as input to ML algorithms. For classical ML techniques (ML), we trained k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, logistic regression, xgboost, and decision tree models to predict the simulation outcome from these geometric features alone. To explore neural network ML techniques, we trained both a three - and a four-hidden layer multilayer perceptron feed forward neural networks (NN), again predicting simulation outcomes from these geometric features alone. ML and NN models were trained on 70% of randomly selected segments and the remaining 30% was used for validation for both baseline and augmented populations. Results: Stimulation in the baseline population (30 patient models) resulted in reentry in 21.8% of sites tested; in the augmented population (129 total patient models) reentry occurred in 13.0% of sites tested. ML and NN models ranged in mean accuracy from 0.83 to 0.86 for the baseline population, improving to 0.88 to 0.89 in all cases. Conclusion: Machine learning techniques, combined with patient-specific, image-based computational simulations, can provide key clinical insights with high accuracy rapidly and efficiently.

34507573;Clinical data;Survival model;The BAriatic surgery SUbstitution and nutrition (BASUN) population: a data-driven exploration of predictors for obesity.;"BACKGROUND: The development of obesity is most likely due to a combination of biological and environmental factors some of which might still be unidentified. We used a machine learning technique to examine the relative importance of more than 100 clinical variables as predictors for BMI. METHODS: BASUN is a prospective non-randomized cohort study of 971 individuals that received medical or surgical treatment (treatment choice was based on patient's preferences and clinical criteria, not randomization) for obesity in the Vastra Gotaland county in Sweden between 2015 and 2017 with planned follow-up for 10 years. This study includes demographic data, BMI, blood tests, and questionnaires before obesity treatment that cover three main areas: gastrointestinal symptoms and eating habits, physical activity and quality of life, and psychological health. We used random forest, with conditional variable importance, to study the relative importance of roughly 100 predictors of BMI, covering 15 domains. We quantified the predictive value of each individual predictor, as well as each domain. RESULTS: The participants received medical (n = 382) or surgical treatment for obesity (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, n = 388; sleeve gastrectomy, n = 201). There were minor differences between these groups before treatment with regard to anthropometrics, laboratory measures and results from questionnaires. The 10 individual variables with the strongest predictive value, in order of decreasing strength, were country of birth, marital status, sex, calcium levels, age, levels of TSH and HbA1c, AUDIT score, BE tendencies according to QEWPR, and TG levels. The strongest domains predicting BMI were: Socioeconomic status, Demographics, Biomarkers (notably TSH), Lifestyle/habits, Biomarkers for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and Potential anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle, habits, age, sex and socioeconomic status are some of the strongest predictors for BMI levels. Potential anxiety and / or depression and other characteristics captured using questionnaires have strong predictive value. These results confirm previously suggested associations and advocate prospective studies to examine the value of better characterization of patients eligible for obesity treatment, and consequently to evaluate the treatment effects in groups of patients.

34426590;Clinical data;Other;Identification of markers that distinguish adipose tissue and glucose and insulin metabolism using a multi-modal machine learning approach.;The study of metabolomics has improved our knowledge of the biology behind type 2 diabetes and its related metabolic physiology. We aimed to investigate markers of adipose tissue morphology, as well as insulin and glucose metabolism in 53 non-obese male individuals. The participants underwent extensive clinical, biochemical and magnetic resonance imaging phenotyping, and we also investigated non-targeted serum metabolites. We used a multi-modal machine learning approach to evaluate which serum metabolomic compounds predicted markers of glucose and insulin metabolism, adipose tissue morphology and distribution. Fasting glucose was associated with metabolites of intracellular insulin action and beta-cell dysfunction, namely cysteine-s-sulphate and n-acetylgarginine, whereas fasting insulin was predicted by myristoleoylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine and other metabolites of beta-oxidation of fatty acids. OGTT-glucose levels at 30 min were predicted by 7-Hoca, a microbiota derived metabolite, as well as eugenol, a fatty acid. Both insulin clamp and HOMA-IR were predicted by metabolites involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids and biodegradation of triacylglycerol, namely tartrate and 3-phosphoglycerate, as well as pyruvate, xanthine and liver fat. OGTT glucose area under curve (AUC) and OGTT insulin AUC, was associated with bile acid metabolites, subcutaneous adipocyte cell size, liver fat and fatty chain acids and derivates, such as isovalerylcarnitine. Finally, subcutaneous adipocyte size was associated with long chain fatty acids, markers of sphingolipid metabolism, increasing liver fat and dopamine-sulfate 1. Ectopic liver fat was predicted by methylmalonate, adipocyte cell size, glutathione derived metabolites and fatty chain acids. Ectopic heart fat was predicted visceral fat, gamma-glutamyl tyrosine and 2-acetamidophenol sulfate. Adipocyte cell size, age, alpha-tocopherol and blood pressure were associated with visceral fat. We identified several biomarkers associated with adipose tissue pathophysiology and insulin and glucose metabolism using a multi-modal machine learning approach. Our approach demonstrated the relative importance of serum metabolites and they outperformed traditional clinical and biochemical variables for most endpoints.;['Henninger J', 'Eliasson B', 'Smith U', 'Rawshani A'];Scientific reports;2021 Aug 23;Rawshani
34147442;Echo;Ventricular function;Artificial Intelligence for Automatic Measurement of Left Ventricular Strain in Echocardiography.;OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine if fully automated measurements of global longitudinal strain (GLS) using a novel motion estimation technology based on deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are feasible and comparable with a conventional speckle-tracking application. BACKGROUND: GLS is an important parameter when evaluating left ventricular function. However, analyses of GLS are time consuming and demand expertise, and thus are underused in clinical practice. METHODS: In this study, 200 patients with a wide range of left ventricle (LV) function were included. Three standard apical cine-loops were analyzed using the AI pipeline. The AI method measured GLS and was compared with a commercially available semiautomatic speckle-tracking software (EchoPAC v202, GE Healthcare. RESULTS: The AI method succeeded to both correctly classify all 3 standard apical views and perform timing of cardiac events in 89% of patients. Furthermore, the method successfully performed automatic segmentation, motion estimates, and measurements of GLS in all examinations, across different cardiac pathologies and throughout the spectrum of LV function. GLS was -12.0 +/- 4.1% for the AI method and -13.5 +/- 5.3% for the reference method. Bias was -1.4 +/- 0.3% (95% limits of agreement: 2.3 to -5.1), which is comparable with intervendor studies. The AI method eliminated measurement variability and a complete GLS analysis was processed within 15 s. CONCLUSIONS: Through the range of LV function this novel AI method succeeds, without any operator input, to automatically identify the 3 standard apical views, perform timing of cardiac events, trace the myocardium, perform motion estimation, and measure GLS. Fully automated measurements based on AI could facilitate the clinical implementation of GLS.;['Salte IM', 'Ostvik A', 'Smistad E', 'Melichova D', 'Nguyen TM', 'Karlsen S', 'Brunvand H', 'Haugaa KH', 'Edvardsen T', 'Lovstakken L', 'Grenne B'];JACC.

33493114;Echo;Ventricular function;Myocardial Function Imaging in Echocardiography Using Deep Learning.;Deformation imaging in echocardiography has been shown to have better diagnostic and prognostic value than conventional anatomical measures such as ejection fraction. However, despite clinical availability and demonstrated efficacy, everyday clinical use remains limited at many hospitals. The reasons are complex, but practical robustness has been questioned, and a large inter-vendor variability has been demonstrated. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning based framework for motion estimation in echocardiography, and use this to fully automate myocardial function imaging. A motion estimator was developed based on a PWC-Net architecture, which achieved an average end point error of (0.06+/-0.04) mm per frame using simulated data from an open access database, on par or better compared to previously reported state of the art. We further demonstrate unique adaptability to image artifacts such as signal dropouts, made possible using trained models that incorporate relevant image augmentations. Further, a fully automatic pipeline consisting of cardiac view classification, event detection, myocardial segmentation and motion estimation was developed and used to estimate left ventricular longitudinal strain in vivo. The method showed promise by achieving a mean deviation of (-0.7+/-1.6)% compared to a semi-automatic commercial solution for N=30 patients with relevant disease, within the expected limits of agreement. We thus believe that learning-based motion estimation can facilitate extended use of strain imaging in clinical practice.;['Ostvik A', 'Salte IM', 'Smistad E', 'Nguyen TM', 'Melichova D', 'Brunvand H', 'Haugaa K', 'Edvardsen T', 'Grenne B', 'Lovstakken L'];IEEE transactions on medical imaging;2021 May;Grenne
32586339;Clinical data;Survival model;Identifying the relative importance of predictors of survival in out of hospital cardiac arrest: a machine learning study.;INTRODUCTION: Studies examining the factors linked to survival after out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have either aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of OHCA in different parts of the world, or focused on certain factors and whether they were associated with survival. Unfortunately, this approach does not measure how strong each factor is in predicting survival after OHCA. AIM: To investigate the relative importance of 16 well-recognized factors in OHCA at the time point of ambulance arrival, and before any interventions or medications were given, by using a machine learning approach that implies building models directly from the data, and arranging those factors in order of importance in predicting survival. METHODS: Using a data-driven approach with a machine learning algorithm, we studied the relative importance of 16 factors assessed during the pre-hospital phase of OHCA. We examined 45,000 cases of OHCA between 2008 and 2016. RESULTS: Overall, the top five factors to predict survival in order of importance were: initial rhythm, age, early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR, time to CPR and CPR before arrival of EMS), time from EMS dispatch until EMS arrival, and place of cardiac arrest. The largest difference in importance was noted between initial rhythm and the remaining predictors. A number of factors, including time of arrest and sex were of little importance. CONCLUSION: Using machine learning, we confirm that the most important predictor of survival in OHCA is initial rhythm, followed by age, time to start of CPR, EMS response time and place of OHCA. Several factors traditionally viewed as important, e.g. sex, were of little importance.;['Al-Dury N', 'Ravn-Fischer A', 'Hollenberg J', 'Israelsson J', 'Nordberg P', 'Stromsoe A', 'Axelsson C', 'Herlitz J', 'Rawshani A'];Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine;2020 Jun 25;Rawshani
32561768;Clinical data;Other;Adipose tissue morphology, imaging and metabolomics predicting cardiometabolic risk and family history of type 2 diabetes in non-obese men.;We evaluated the importance of body composition, amount of subcutaneous and visceral fat, liver and heart ectopic fat, adipose tissue distribution and cell size as predictors of cardio-metabolic risk in 53 non-obese male individuals. Known family history of type 2 diabetes was identified in 25 individuals. The participants also underwent extensive phenotyping together with measuring different biomarkers and non-targeted serum metabolomics. We used ensemble learning and other machine learning approaches to identify predictors with considerable relative importance and their intricate interactions. Visceral fat and age were strong individual predictors of ectopic fat accumulation in liver and heart along with markers of lipid oxidation and reduced glucose tolerance. Subcutaneous adipose cell size was the strongest individual predictor of whole-body insulin sensitivity and also a marker of visceral and ectopic fat accumulation. The metabolite 3-MOB along with related branched-chain amino acids demonstrated strong predictability for family history of type 2 diabetes.;['Rawshani A', 'Eliasson B', 'Rawshani A', 'Henninger J', 'Mardinoglu A', 'Carlsson A', 'Sohlin M', 'Ljungberg M', 'Hammarstedt A', 'Rosengren A', 'Smith U'];Scientific reports;2020 Jun 19;Rawshani
32175861;Echo;Ventricular function;Real-Time Automatic Ejection Fraction and Foreshortening Detection Using Deep Learning.;Volume and ejection fraction (EF) measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in 2-D echocardiography are associated with a high uncertainty not only due to interobserver variability of the manual measurement, but also due to ultrasound acquisition errors such as apical foreshortening. In this work, a real-time and fully automated EF measurement and foreshortening detection method is proposed. The method uses several deep learning components, such as view classification, cardiac cycle timing, segmentation and landmark extraction, to measure the amount of foreshortening, LV volume, and EF. A data set of 500 patients from an outpatient clinic was used to train the deep neural networks, while a separate data set of 100 patients from another clinic was used for evaluation, where LV volume and EF were measured by an expert using clinical protocols and software. A quantitative analysis using 3-D ultrasound showed that EF is considerably affected by apical foreshortening, and that the proposed method can detect and quantify the amount of apical foreshortening. The bias and standard deviation of the automatic EF measurements were -3.6 +/- 8.1%, while the mean absolute difference was measured at 7.2% which are all within the interobserver variability and comparable with related studies. The proposed real-time pipeline allows for a continuous acquisition and measurement workflow without user interaction, and has the potential to significantly reduce the time spent on the analysis and measurement error due to foreshortening, while providing quantitative volume measurements in the everyday echo lab.;['Smistad E', 'Ostvik A', 'Salte IM', 'Melichova D', 'Nguyen TM', 'Haugaa K', 'Brunvand H', 'Edvardsen T', 'Leclerc S', 'Bernard O', 'Grenne B', 'Lovstakken L'];IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control;2020 Dec;Grenne
30798638;Clinical data;Other;Relative Prognostic Importance and Optimal Levels of Risk Factors for Mortality and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.;BACKGROUND: The strength of association and optimal levels for risk factors related to excess risk of death and cardiovascular outcomes in type 1 diabetes mellitus have been sparsely studied. METHODS: In a national observational cohort study from the Swedish National Diabetes Register from 1998 to 2014, we assessed relative prognostic importance of 17 risk factors for death and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus. We used Cox regression and machine learning analyses. In addition, we examined optimal cut point levels for glycohemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus were followed up until death or study end on December 31, 2013. The primary outcomes were death resulting from all causes, fatal/nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, fatal/nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. RESULTS: Of 32 611 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, 1809 (5.5%) died during follow-up over 10.4 years. The strongest predictors for death and cardiovascular outcomes were glycohemoglobin, albuminuria, duration of diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Glycohemoglobin displayed  approximately 2% higher risk for each 1-mmol/mol increase (equating to  approximately 22% per 1% glycohemoglobin difference), whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was associated with 35% to 50% greater risk for each 1-mmol/L increase. Microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria was associated with 2 to 4 times greater risk for cardiovascular complications and death. Glycohemoglobin <53 mmol/mol (7.0%), systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <2.5 mmol/L were associated with significantly lower risk for outcomes observed. CONCLUSIONS: Glycohemoglobin, albuminuria, duration of diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol appear to be the most important predictors for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Lower levels for glycohemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than contemporary guideline target levels appear to be associated with significantly lower risk for outcomes.;['Rawshani A', 'Rawshani A', 'Sattar N', 'Franzen S', 'McGuire DK', 'Eliasson B', 'Svensson AM', 'Zethelius B', 'Miftaraj M', 'Rosengren A', 'Gudbjornsdottir S'];Circulation;2019 Apr 16;Rawshani
