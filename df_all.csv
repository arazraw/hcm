39772357,Yes,Yes,No,No,Demographic-Based Personalized Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Thresholds for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Diagnosis.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death. Current diagnosis emphasizes the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) using a fixed threshold of >/=15-mm maximum wall thickness (MWT). This study proposes a method that considers individual demographics to adjust LVH thresholds as an alternative to a 1-size-fits-all approach. METHODS: Left ventricular MWT was measured in 3 cohorts: a Reference Cohort of healthy adults (n = 5,067, no comorbidities), a Population Cohort (n = 43,239, with comorbidities), and an HCM Cohort from 6 international centers (n = 2,424). Measurement used cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and a validated artificial intelligence algorithm. The Reference Cohort was used to developed demographically adjusted LVH thresholds, and individualized z-scores based on age, sex, and body surface area (BSA), which were used to explore the other cohorts. RESULTS: The traditional >/=15-mm threshold classified 4.3% (n = 1,854) of the Population Cohort as hypertrophic, with a significant sex skew (89% male). Demographic-adjusted LVH thresholds (range: 10-17 mm) reduced ascertainment to 2.2% (n = 945), reducing the sex skew (56% male). Similar reductions in bias with height, weight, and age also occurred. The HCM cohort was found to have a 2:1 male-to-female ratio. A significant proportion of patients received diagnoses of HCM despite having MWT below the traditional LVH threshold (<15 mm): 27% of female individuals and 18% of male individuals. Using demographic-adjusted LVH thresholds reduced these proportions to 7% of female individuals and 15% of male individuals (P < 0.0001). Female patients had lower absolute MWT (18 mm vs 19 mm; P < 0.001) but higher MWT z-scores (5.1 vs 4.5; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Age, sex, and body size influence the normal heart MWT. Using a fixed LVH threshold >/=15 mm biases LVH ascertainment in both population and HCM cohorts. A demographic-adjusted approach for LVH improves ascertainment and diagnostic accuracy."
39706305,Yes,Yes,No,No,Detection of late gadolinium enhancement in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using machine learning.,"BACKGROUND: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) typically represents myocardial fibrosis and may lead to fatal ventricular arrhythmias. However, CMR is resource-intensive and sometimes contraindicated. Thus, in patients with HCM, we aimed to detect LGE on CMR by applying machine learning (ML) algorithm to clinical parameters. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this trans-Pacific multicenter study of HCM, a ML model was developed to distinguish the presence or absence of LGE on CMR by ridge classification method using 22 clinical parameters including 9 echocardiographic data. Among 742 patients in this cohort, the ML model was constructed in 2 institutions in the United States (training set, n = 554) and tested using data from an institution in Japan (test set, n = 188). LGE was detected in 299 patients (54%) in the training set and 76 patients (40%) in the test set. In the test set, the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of the ML model derived from the training set was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.84). When compared with a reference model constructed with 3 conventional risk factors for LGE on CMR (AUC 0.69 [95% CI 0.61-0.77]), the ML model outperformed the reference model (DeLong's test P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This trans-Pacific study demonstrates that ML analysis of clinical parameters can distinguish the presence of LGE on CMR in patients with HCM. Our ML model would help physicians identify patients with HCM in whom the pre-test probability of LGE is high, and therefore CMR will have higher utility."
39701955,Yes,Yes,No,No,Identification and validation of differentially expressed disulfidptosis-related genes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases with no effective treatment due to its complex pathogenesis. A novel cell death, disulfidptosis, has been extensively studied in the cancer field but rarely in cardiovascular diseases. This study revealed the potential relationship between disulfidptosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and put forward a predictive model containing disulfidptosis-associated genes (DRGs) of GYS1, MYH10, PDMIL1, SLC3A2, CAPZB, showing excellent performance by SVM machine learning model. The results were further validated by western blot, RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry in a TAC mice model. In addition, resveratrol was selected as a therapeutic drug targeting core genes using the CTD database. In summary, this study provides new perspectives for exploring disulfidptosis-related biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
39698121,Yes,Yes,No,No,HCM-Echo-VAR-Ensemble: Deep Ensemble Fusion to Detect Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Echocardiograms.,"Goal: To detect Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) from multiple views of Echocardiogram (cardiac ultrasound) videos. Methods: we propose HCM-Echo-VAR-Ensemble, a novel framework that performs binary classification (HCM vs. no HCM) of echocardiogram videos directly using an ensemble of state-of-the-art deep VAR architectures models (SlowFast and I3D), and fuses their predictions using majority averaging ensembling. Results: HCM-Echo-VAR-Ensemble achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 95.28%, an F1-Score of 95.20%, a specificity of 96.20%, a sensitivity of 93.97%, a PPV of 96.46%, an NPV of 94.17%, and an AUC of 98.42%, outperforming a comprehensive set of baselines including other ensembling approaches. Conclusions: Our proposed HCM-Echo-VAR-Ensemble framework demonstrates significant potential for improving the sensitivity and accuracy of HCM detection in clinical settings, particularly by ensembling the complementary strengths of the SlowFast and I3D deep VAR models. This approach can enhance diagnostic consistency and accuracy, enabling reliable HCM diagnoses even in low-resource environments."
39694602,Yes,Yes,No,No,Prediction of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using machine learning.,"AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia among patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), leading to increased symptom burden and risk of thromboembolism. The HCM-AF score was developed to predict new-onset AF in patients with HCM, though sensitivity and specificity of this conventional tool are limited. Thus, there is a need for more accurate tools to predict new-onset AF in HCM. The objective of the present study was to develop a better model to predict new-onset AF in patients with HCM using machine learning (ML). METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective, multicentre cohort study, we enrolled 1069 patients with HCM without a prior history of AF. We built a ML model (logistic regression with Lasso regularization) using clinical variables. We developed the ML model using the cohort from one institution (training set) and applied it to an independent cohort from a separate institution (test set). We used the HCM-AF score as a reference model. We compared the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) between the ML model and the reference model using the DeLong's test. Median follow-up time was 2.1 years, with 128 (12%) patients developing new-onset AF. Using the ML model developed in the training set to predict new-onset AF, the AUC in the test set was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.91). The ML model outperformed the reference model (AUC 0.64; 95% CI 0.54-0.73; DeLong's p < 0.001). The ML model had higher sensitivity (0.82; 95% CI 0.65-0.93) than that of the reference model (0.67; 95% CI 0.52-0.88). The ML model also had higher specificity (0.76; 95% CI 0.71-0.81) than that of the reference model (0.57; 95% CI 0.41-0.70). Among the most important clinical variables included in the ML-based model were left atrial volume and diameter, left ventricular outflow tract gradient with exercise stress and at rest, late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, peak heart rate during exercise stress, age at diagnosis, positive genotype, diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease. CONCLUSION: Our ML model showed superior performance compared to the conventional HCM-AF score for the prediction of new-onset AF in patients with HCM."
39557527,Yes,Yes,No,No,[Study on predicting new onset heart failure events in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using machine learning algorithms based on clinical and magnetic resonance features].,"Objective: To explore the value of predicting new-onset heart failure events in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using clinical and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) features based on machine learning algorithms. Methods: The study was a retrospective cohort study. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HCM who underwent CMR examinations at Beijing Anzhen Hospital from May 2017 to March 2021 were selected and randomly divided into the training set and the validation set in a ratio of 7ratio3. Clinical data and CMR parameters (including conventional parameters and radiomics features) were collected. The endpoint events were heart failure hospitalization and heart failure death, with follow-up ending in January 2023. Features with high stability and P value<0.05 in univariate Cox regression analysis were selected. Subsequently, three machine learning algorithms-random forest, decision tree, and XGBoost-were used to build heart failure event prediction models in the training set. The model performance was then evaluated using the independent validation set, with the performance assessed based on the concordance index. Results: A total of 462 patients were included, with a median age of 51 (39, 62) years, of whom 332 (71.9%) were male. There were 323 patients in the training set and 139 in the validation set. The median follow-up time was 42 (28, 52) months. A total of 44 patients (9.5% (44/462)) experienced endpoint events (8 cases of heart failure death and 36 cases of heart failure hospitalization), with 31 events in the training set and 13 in the validation set. Univariate Cox regression analysis identified 39 radiomic features, 4 conventional CMR parameters (left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and late gadolinium enhancement ratio), and 1 clinical feature (history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) that could be included in the machine learning model. In the prediction models built with the training set, the concordance indices for the random forest, decision tree, and XGBoost models were 0.966 (95%CI 0.813-0.995), 0.956 (95%CI 0.796-0.992), and 0.973 (95%CI 0.823-0.996), respectively. In the validation set, the concordance indices for the random forest, decision tree, and XGBoost models were 0.854 (95%CI 0.557-0.964), 0.706 (95%CI 0.399-0.896), and 0.703 (95%CI 0.408-0.890), respectively. Conclusion: Integrating clinical and CMR features of HCM patients through machine learning aids in predicting heart failure events, with the random forest model showing superior performance."
39535387,Yes,Yes,No,No,Integration analysis using bioinformatics and experimental validation on cellular signalling for sex differences of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"There is a paucity of research examining the molecular mechanisms underlying sex differences of clinical phenotypes and the prognosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The dataset GSE36961 was retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and comprehensive bioinformatics was employed to identify the core genes linked to sex differences in HCM patients. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to detect downstream signalling pathways. Furthermore, experimental validation was carried out using hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). A comprehensive analysis revealed the identification of 208 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in female patients with HCM with a notable downregulation of seven core genes. Notably, there were sex differences in the expression of ras dexamethasone-induced protein 1 (RASD1) and myosin 6 (MYH6) in HCM. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and GSEA demonstrated an enrichment of autophagy-related processes in disease progression in HCM females. Specifically, spearman's correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) and RASD1 levels, particularly among female patients (R = 0.569, p < 0.001). Additionally, animal models confirmed that cardiac hypertrophy was more pronounced in SHR females compared to males. SHR females exhibited lower mRNA and protein expressions of RASD1 and NAMPT, which were associated with impaired autophagy. In this study, bioinformatics and validation using external data sets and animal models of left ventricular hypertrophy suggested that the RASD1/NAMPT axis is potentially a crucial mechanism underlying the elevated risk of cardiovascular disorders in HCM females, also pointing potentially prognostic biomarkers."
39459004,Yes,Yes,No,No,A Machine Learning Approach to Gene Expression in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common heart disorder characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, particularly in the left ventricle, which increases the risk of cardiac complications. This study aims to analyze the expression of apoptosis-regulating genes (CASP8, CASP9, CASP3, BAX, and BCL2) in blood samples from HCM patients, to better understand their potential as biomarkers for disease progression. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to evaluate gene expression in blood samples from 93 HCM patients. The correlation between apoptosis-regulating genes was conducted and clinical parameters were integrated for feature importance and clustering analysis. RESULTS: Most patients exhibited significant downregulation of CASP8, CASP9, and CASP3. In contrast, BAX expression was elevated in 71 out of 93 patients, while BCL2 was increased in 55 out of 93 patients. Correlation analysis revealed weak negative correlations between the BAX/BCL2 ratio and CASP gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that reduced expression of apoptotic genes may indicate a protective cellular mechanism, which could serve as a biomarker for disease progression. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential for therapeutic modulation of these pathways to improve patient outcomes."
39441047,Yes,Yes,No,No,Prediction of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using plasma proteomics profiling.,"AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia among patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), increasing symptom burden and stroke risk. We aimed to construct a plasma proteomics-based model to predict new-onset AF in patients with HCM and determine dysregulated signalling pathways. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective, multi-centre cohort study, we conducted plasma proteomics profiling of 4986 proteins at enrolment. We developed a proteomics-based machine learning model to predict new-onset AF using samples from one institution (training set) and tested its predictive ability using independent samples from another institution (test set). We performed a survival analysis to compare the risk of new-onset AF among high- and low-risk groups in the test set. We performed pathway analysis of proteins significantly (univariable P < 0.05) associated with new-onset AF using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.001. The study included 284 patients with HCM (training set: 193, test set: 91). Thirty-seven (13%) patients developed AF during median follow-up of 3.2 years [25-75 percentile: 1.8-5.2]. Using the proteomics-based prediction model developed in the training set, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.99) in the test set. In the test set, patients categorized as high risk had a higher rate of developing new-onset AF (log-rank P = 0.002). The Ras-MAPK pathway was dysregulated in patients who developed incident AF during follow-up (FDR < 1.0 x 10-6). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate the ability of plasma proteomics to predict new-onset AF in HCM and identify dysregulated signalling pathways."
39396969,Yes,Yes,No,No,Deep learning of echocardiography distinguishes between presence and absence of late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can cause myocardial fibrosis, which can be a substrate for fatal ventricular arrhythmias and subsequent sudden cardiac death. Although late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) represents myocardial fibrosis and is associated with sudden cardiac death in patients with HCM, CMR is resource-intensive, can carry an economic burden, and is sometimes contraindicated. In this study for patients with HCM, we aimed to distinguish between patients with positive and negative LGE on CMR using deep learning of echocardiographic images. METHODS: In the cross-sectional study of patients with HCM, we enrolled patients who underwent both echocardiography and CMR. The outcome was positive LGE on CMR. Among the 323 samples, we randomly selected 273 samples (training set) and employed deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) of echocardiographic 5-chamber view to discriminate positive LGE on CMR. We also developed a reference model using clinical parameters with significant differences between patients with positive and negative LGE. In the remaining 50 samples (test set), we compared the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) between a combined model using the reference model plus the DCNN-derived probability and the reference model. RESULTS: Among the 323 CMR studies, positive LGE was detected in 160 (50%). The reference model was constructed using the following 7 clinical parameters: family history of HCM, maximum left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, LV end-diastolic diameter, LV end-systolic volume, LV ejection fraction < 50%, left atrial diameter, and LV outflow tract pressure gradient at rest. The discriminant model combining the reference model with DCNN-derived probability significantly outperformed the reference model in the test set (AUC 0.86 [95% confidence interval 0.76-0.96] vs. 0.72 [0.57-0.86], P = 0.04). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the combined model were 0.84, 0.76, 0.78, and 0.83, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared to the reference model solely based on clinical parameters, our new model integrating the reference model and deep learning-based analysis of echocardiographic images demonstrated superiority in distinguishing LGE on CMR in patients with HCM. The novel deep learning-based method can be used as an assistive technology to facilitate the decision-making process of performing CMR with gadolinium enhancement."
39350610,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine learning and radiomics for ventricular tachyarrhythmia prediction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: insights from an MRI-based analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial fibrosis is often detected in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which causes left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and tachyarrhythmias. PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential value of a machine learning (ML) approach that uses radiomic features from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and cine images for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) in patients with HCM. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hyperenhancing areas of LV myocardium on LGE images were manually segmented, and the segmentation was propagated to corresponding areas on cine images. Radiomic features were extracted using the PyRadiomics library. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was employed for radiomic feature selection. Our model development employed the TabPFN algorithm, an adapted Prior-Data Fitted Network design. Model performance was evaluated graphically and numerically over five-repeat fivefold cross-validation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to determine the relative importance of selected radiomic features. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 60 patients with HCM (73.3% male; median age = 51.5 years), among whom 17 had documented VT during the follow-up. A total of 1612 radiomic features were extracted for each patient. The LASSO algorithm led to a final selection of 18 radiomic features. The model achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.877, demonstrating good discrimination, and a mean Brier score of 0.119, demonstrating good calibration. CONCLUSION: Radiomics-based ML models are promising for predicting VT in patients with HCM during the follow-up period. Developing predictive models as clinically useful decision-making tools may significantly improve risk assessment and prognosis."
39160643,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine learning and experimental validation of novel biomarkers for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cancers.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a hereditary cardiac disorder marked by anomalous thickening of the myocardium, representing a significant contributor to mortality. While the involvement of immune inflammation in the development of cardiac ailments is well-documented, its specific impact on HCM pathogenesis remains uncertain. Five distinct machine learning algorithms, namely LASSO, SVM, RF, Boruta and XGBoost, were utilized to discover new biomarkers associated with HCM. A unique nomogram was developed using two newly identified biomarkers and subsequently validated. Furthermore, samples of HCM and normal heart tissues were gathered from our institution to confirm the variance in expression levels and prognostic significance of GATM and MGST1. Five novel biomarkers (DARS2, GATM, MGST1, SDSL and ARG2) associated with HCM were identified. Subsequent validation revealed that GATM and MGST1 exhibited significant diagnostic utility for HCM in both the training and test cohorts, with all AUC values exceeding 0.8. Furthermore, a novel risk assessment model for HCM patients based on the expression levels of GATM and MGST1 demonstrated favourable performance in both the training (AUC = 0.88) and test cohorts (AUC = 0.9). Furthermore, our study revealed that GATM and MGST1 exhibited elevated expression levels in HCM tissues, demonstrating strong discriminatory ability between HCM and normal cardiac tissues (AUC of GATM = 0.79; MGST1 = 0.86). Our findings suggest that two specific cell types, monocytes and multipotent progenitors (MPP), may play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of HCM. Notably, GATM and MGST1 were found to be highly expressed in various tumours and showed significant prognostic implications. Functionally, GATM and MGST1 are likely involved in xenobiotic metabolism and epithelial mesenchymal transition in a wide range of cancer types. GATM and MGST1 have been identified as novel biomarkers implicated in the progression of both HCM and cancer. Additionally, monocytes and MPP may also play a role in facilitating the progression of HCM."
39043774,Yes,Yes,No,No,A personalized mRNA signature for predicting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy applying machine learning methods.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may lead to cardiac dysfunction and sudden death. This study was designed to develop a HCM signature applying bioinformatics and machine learning methods. Data of HCM and normal tissues were obtained from public databases to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the R software limma package. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed for enrichment analysis of HCM-associated DEGs. Hub genes for HCM were determined using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) together with two machine learning algorithms (SVM-RFE and LASSO). Finally, we introduced a zebrafish model to simulate changes in the hub genes in the HCM and to observe their effects on cardiac disease development. The mRNA expression data from a total of 106 HCM tissues and 39 normal samples were collected and we screened 157 DEGs. Enrichment analysis showed that immune pathways played an important role in the pathogenesis of HCM. Three hub genes (FCN3, MYH6 and RASD1) were identified using WGCNA, SVM-RFE, and LASSO analysis. In a zebrafish model, knockdown of MYH6 and RASD1 resulted in cardiac malformations with reduced ventricular capacity and heart rate, which validated the clinical significance of these genes in the diagnosis of HCM. Based on machine learning algorithms, our study created a signature with potential impact on cardiac function and cardiac quality index for HCM. The current findings had important implications for the early diagnosis and treatment of HCM."
39001729,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine Learning in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Nonlinear Model From Clinical and CMR Features Predicting Cardiovascular Events.,"BACKGROUND: The cumulative burden of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is significant, with a noteworthy percentage (10%-15%) of patients with HCM per year experiencing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). A current risk stratification scheme for HCM had only limited accuracy in predicting sudden cardiac death (SCD) and failed to account for a broader spectrum of adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) parameters. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to develop and evaluate a machine learning (ML) framework that integrates CMR imaging and clinical characteristics to predict MACEs in patients with HCM. METHODS: A total of 758 patients with HCM (67% male; age 49 +/- 14 years) who were admitted between 2010 and 2017 from 4 medical centers were included. The ML model was built on the internal discovery cohort (533 patients with HCM, admitted to Fuwai Hospital, Beijing, China) by using the light gradient-boosting machine and internally evaluated using cross-validation. The external test cohort consisted of 225 patients with HCM from 3 medical centers. A total of 14 CMR imaging features (strain and late gadolinium enhancement [LGE]) and 23 clinical variables were evaluated and used to inform the ML model. MACEs included a composite of arrhythmic events, SCD, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation-related stroke. RESULTS: MACEs occurred in 191 (25%) patients over a median follow-up period of 109.0 months (Q1-Q3: 73.0-118.8 months). Our ML model achieved areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.830 and 0.812 (internally and externally, respectively). The model outperformed the classic HCM Risk-SCD model, with significant improvement (P < 0.001) of 22.7% in the AUC. Using the cubic spline analysis, the study showed that the extent of LGE and the impairment of global radial strain (GRS) and global circumferential strain (GCS) were nonlinearly correlated with MACEs: an elevated risk of adverse cardiovascular events was observed when these parameters reached the high enough second tertiles (11.6% for LGE, 25.8% for GRS, -17.3% for GCS). CONCLUSIONS: ML-empowered risk stratification using CMR and clinical features enabled accurate MACE prediction beyond the classic HCM Risk-SCD model. In addition, the nonlinear correlation between CMR features (LGE and left ventricular pressure gradient) and MACEs uncovered in this study provides valuable insights for the clinical assessment and management of HCM."
38847081,Yes,Yes,No,No,Novel Multiplexed Plasma Biomarker Panel Has Diagnostic and Prognostic Potential in Children With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined clinically by pathological left ventricular hypertrophy. We have previously developed a plasma proteomics biomarker panel that correlates with clinical markers of disease severity and sudden cardiac death risk in adult patients with HCM. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of adult biomarkers and perform new discoveries in proteomics for childhood-onset HCM. METHODS: Fifty-nine protein biomarkers were identified from an exploratory plasma proteomics screen in children with HCM and augmented into our existing multiplexed targeted liquid chromatography-tandem/mass spectrometry-based assay. The association of these biomarkers with clinical phenotypes and outcomes was prospectively tested in plasma collected from 148 children with HCM and 50 healthy controls. Machine learning techniques were used to develop novel pediatric plasma proteomic biomarker panels. RESULTS: Four previously identified adult HCM markers (aldolase fructose-bisphosphate A, complement C3a, talin-1, and thrombospondin 1) and 3 new markers (glycogen phosphorylase B, lipoprotein a and profilin 1) were elevated in pediatric HCM. Using supervised machine learning applied to training (n=137) and validation cohorts (n=61), this 7-biomarker panel differentiated HCM from healthy controls with an area under the curve of 1.0 in the training data set (sensitivity 100% [95% CI, 95-100]; specificity 100% [95% CI, 96-100]) and 0.82 in the validation data set (sensitivity 75% [95% CI, 59-86]; specificity 88% [95% CI, 75-94]). Reduced circulating levels of 4 other peptides (apolipoprotein L1, complement 5b, immunoglobulin heavy constant epsilon, and serum amyloid A4) found in children with high sudden cardiac death risk provided complete separation from the low and intermediate risk groups and predicted mortality and adverse arrhythmic outcomes (hazard ratio, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.0-4.2]; P=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: In children, a 7-biomarker proteomics panel can distinguish HCM from controls with high sensitivity and specificity, and another 4-biomarker panel identifies those at high risk of adverse arrhythmic outcomes, including sudden cardiac death."
38815672,Yes,Yes,No,No,Unveiling MiRNA-124 as a biomarker in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: An innovative approach using machine learning and intelligent data analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a widespread hereditary cardiac pathology characterized by thickened heart walls and rearrangement of cardiomyocytes. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying HCM development remain poorly understood, impeding the development of effective therapeutic and diagnostic strategies. Recent studies have suggested a polygenic nature of HCM development alongside monogenic forms. Transcriptomic profiling is a valuable tool for investigating such diseases. In this study, we propose a novel approach to study regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) in the context of HCM, utilizing state-of-the-art data analysis tools. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our method involves applying the Monte Carlo simulation and machine learning algorithm to transcriptomic data to generate high-capacity classifiers for HCM. From these classifiers, we extract key genes crucial for their performance, resulting in the identification of 16 key genes. Subsequently, we narrow down the pool of miRNAs by selecting those that may target the greatest number of key genes within the best models. We particularly focused on miR-124-3p, which we validated to have an association with HCM on an independent dataset. Subsequent investigation of its function revealed involvement of miR-124-3p in the RhoA signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we propose a new approach to analyze transcriptomic data to search for microRNAs associated with a disease. Using this approach for transcriptomic profiling data of patients with HCM, we identified miR-124-3p as a potential regulator of the RhoA signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of HCM."
38765660,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine Learning-Based Discrimination of Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Current risk stratification strategies for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are limited to traditional methodologies. OBJECTIVES: The authors aimed to establish machine learning (ML)-based models to discriminate major cardiovascular events in patients with HCM. METHODS: We enrolled consecutive HCM patients from 2 tertiary referral centers and used 25 clinical and echocardiographic features to discriminate major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including all-cause death, admission for heart failure (HF-adm), and stroke. The best model was selected for each outcome using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) with 20-fold cross-validation. After testing in the external validation cohort, the relative importance of features in discriminating each outcome was determined using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. RESULTS: In total, 2,111 patients with HCM (age 61.4 +/- 13.6 years; 67.6% men) were analyzed. During the median 4.0 years of follow-up, MACE occurred in 341 patients (16.2%). Among the 4 ML models, the logistic regression model achieved the best AUROC of 0.800 (95% CI: 0.760-0.841) for MACE, 0.789 (95% CI: 0.736-0.841) for all-cause death, 0.798 (95% CI: 0.736-0.860) for HF-adm, and 0.807 (95% CI: 0.754-0.859) for stroke. The discriminant ability of the logistic regression model remained excellent when applied to the external validation cohort for MACE (AUROC = 0.768), all-cause death (AUROC = 0.750), and HF-adm (AUROC = 0.806). The SHAP analysis identified left atrial diameter and hypertension as important variables for all outcomes of interest. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed ML models incorporating various phenotypes from patients with HCM accurately discriminated adverse cardiovascular events and provided variables with high importance for each outcome."
38706878,Yes,Yes,No,No,A Deep Learning Approach to Classify Fabry Cardiomyopathy from Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Using Cine Imaging on Cardiac Magnetic Resonance.,"A challenge in accurately identifying and classifying left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is distinguishing it from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and Fabry disease. The reliance on imaging techniques often requires the expertise of multiple specialists, including cardiologists, radiologists, and geneticists. This variability in the interpretation and classification of LVH leads to inconsistent diagnoses. LVH, HCM, and Fabry cardiomyopathy can be differentiated using T1 mapping on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, differentiation between HCM and Fabry cardiomyopathy using echocardiography or MRI cine images is challenging for cardiologists. Our proposed system named the MRI short-axis view left ventricular hypertrophy classifier (MSLVHC) is a high-accuracy standardized imaging classification model developed using AI and trained on MRI short-axis (SAX) view cine images to distinguish between HCM and Fabry disease. The model achieved impressive performance, with an F1-score of 0.846, an accuracy of 0.909, and an AUC of 0.914 when tested on the Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) dataset. Additionally, a single-blinding study and external testing using data from the Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH) demonstrated the reliability and effectiveness of the model, achieving an F1-score of 0.727, an accuracy of 0.806, and an AUC of 0.918, demonstrating the model's reliability and usefulness. This AI model holds promise as a valuable tool for assisting specialists in diagnosing LVH diseases."
38629342,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine learning-driven diagnostic signature provides new insights in clinical management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"AIMS: In an era of evolving diagnostic possibilities, existing diagnostic systems are not fully sufficient to promptly recognize patients with early-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) without symptomatic and instrumental features. Considering the sudden death of HCM, developing a novel diagnostic model to clarify the patients with early-stage HCM and the immunological characteristics can avoid misdiagnosis and attenuate disease progression. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-five samples from four independent cohorts were systematically retrieved. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differential expression analysis (|log2(foldchange)| > 0.5 and adjusted P < 0.05), and protein-protein interaction network were sequentially performed to identify HCM-related hub genes. With a machine learning algorithm, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression algorithm, a stable diagnostic model was developed. The immune-cell infiltration and biological functions of HCM were also explored to characterize its underlying pathogenic mechanisms and the immune signature. Two key modules were screened based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Pathogenic mechanisms relevant to extracellular matrix and immune pathways have been discovered. Twenty-seven co-regulated genes were recognized as HCM-related hub genes. Based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm, a stable HCM diagnostic model was constructed, which was further validated in the remaining three cohorts (n = 385). Considering the tight association between HCM and immune-related functions, we assessed the infiltrating abundance of various immune cells and stromal cells based on the xCell algorithm, and certain immune cells were significantly different between high-risk and low-risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a number of hub genes and novel pathways to provide potential targets for the treatment of HCM. A stable model was developed, providing an efficient tool for the diagnosis of HCM."
38589224,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine learning-based detection of sleep-disordered breathing in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is often concomitant with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which can cause adverse cardiovascular events. Although an appropriate approach to SDB prevents cardiac remodelling, detection of concomitant SDB in patients with HCM remains suboptimal. Thus, we aimed to develop a machine learning-based discriminant model for SDB in HCM. METHODS: In the present multicentre study, we consecutively registered patients with HCM and performed nocturnal oximetry. The outcome was a high Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI), defined as 3% ODI >10, which significantly correlated with the presence of moderate or severe SDB. We randomly divided the whole participants into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). With data from the training set, we developed a random forest discriminant model for high ODI based on clinical parameters. We tested the ability of the discriminant model on the test set and compared it with a previous logistic regression model for distinguishing SDB in patients with HCM. RESULTS: Among 369 patients with HCM, 228 (61.8%) had high ODI. In the test set, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the discriminant model was 0.86 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.94). The sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.98) and specificity was 0.68 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.84). When the test set was divided into low-probability and high-probability groups, the high-probability group had a higher prevalence of high ODI than the low-probability group (82.4% vs 17.4%, OR 20.9 (95% CI 5.3 to 105.8), Fisher's exact test p<0.001). The discriminant model significantly outperformed the previous logistic regression model (DeLong test p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study serves as the first to develop a machine learning-based discriminant model for the concomitance of SDB in patients with HCM. The discriminant model may facilitate cost-effective screening tests and treatments for SDB in the population with HCM."
38540296,Yes,Yes,No,No,Role of Genetics in Diagnosis and Management of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: A Glimpse into the Future.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy. It follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in most cases, with incomplete penetrance and heterogeneity. It is familial in 60% of cases and most of these are caused by pathogenic variants in the core sarcomeric genes (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, MYL2, MYL3, TPM1, ACTC1). Genetic testing using targeted disease-specific panels that utilize next-generation sequencing (NGS) and include sarcomeric genes with the strongest evidence of association and syndrome-associated genes is highly recommended for every HCM patient to confirm the diagnosis, identify the molecular etiology, and guide screening and management. The yield of genetic testing for a disease-causing variant is 30% in sporadic cases and up to 60% in familial cases and in younger patients with typical asymmetrical septal hypertrophy. Genetic testing remains challenging in the interpretation of results and classification of variants. Therefore, in 2015 the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) established guidelines to classify and interpret the variants with an emphasis on the necessity of periodic reassessment of variant classification as genetic knowledge rapidly expands. The current guidelines recommend focused cascade genetic testing regardless of age in phenotype-negative first-degree relatives if a variant with decisive evidence of pathogenicity has been identified in the proband. Genetic test results in family members guide longitudinal clinical surveillance. At present, there is emerging evidence for genetic test application in risk stratification and management but its implementation into clinical practice needs further study. Promising fields such as gene therapy and implementation of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of HCM are emerging and paving the way for more effective screening and management, but many challenges and obstacles need to be overcome before establishing the practical implications of these new methods."
38522619,Yes,Yes,No,No,Trans-Atlantic Differences in Approach to Sudden Death Prevention in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"The American approach to predicting sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy diverges from the European method in that it relies on major risk factors independently justifying the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention, whereas the European approach uses a mathematical equation to estimate a 5-year risk percentage. The aim of this review is to outline the differences between the American and European guidelines and to show how they have arisen. Furthermore, it will provide insight into the future of SCD risk prediction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The American SCD risk prediction method has high sensitivity but limited specificity, whereas the European method has the opposite. These differences in sensitivity and specificity likely contribute to the fact that primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator utilization is twofold higher in the United States. It is highly likely that new insights and new imaging modalities will enhance prediction models in the near future. Genotyping could potentially assume a significant role. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain was recently shown to be an independent predictor of SCD. Furthermore, after late gadolinium enhancement, additional cardiac magnetic resonance techniques such as T1 mapping and diffusion tensor imaging are showing encouraging outcomes in predicting SCD. Ultimately, it is conceivable that integrating diverse morphological and genetic characteristics through deep learning will yield novel insights and enhance SCD prediction methods."
38467329,Yes,Yes,No,No,Scanning the Imaging Horizon for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"In this article some of the recent advances in the use of noninvasive imaging applied to patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are discussed. Echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography are briefly discussed with respect to their power to detect apical aneurysmal disease. Echocardiographic phenotype-genotype correlations and the use of echocardiography to characterize myocardial work are reviewed. Positron emission tomography is reviewed in the context of ischemia imaging and also in the context of the use of a new tracer that might allow for recognition of early activation of the fibrosis pathway. Next, the technical capabilities of cardiovascular magnetic resonance to measure myocardial perfusion, oxygenation, and disarray are discussed as they apply to HCM. The application of radiomics to improve prediction of sudden cardiac death is touched upon. Finally, a deep learning approach to the recognition of HCM vs phenocopies is presented as a potential future diagnostic aid in the not-too-distant future."
38180696,Yes,Yes,No,No,"The China Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Project (CHCMP): The Rationale and Design of a Multicenter, Prospective, Registry Cohort Study.","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with adverse outcomes, such as heart failure, arrhythmia, and mortality. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a common cause of death in HCM patients, and identification of patients at a high risk of SCD is crucial in clinical practice. The China Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Project is a hospital-based, multicenter, prospective, registry cohort study of HCM patients, covering a total of 3000 participants and with a 5-year follow-up plan. A large number of demographic characteristics and clinical data will be fully collected to identify prognostic factors in Chinese HCM patients. Furthermore, the main purpose of this study is to integrate demographic and clinical characteristics to establish new 5-year SCD risk predictive equations for Chinese HCM patients by the use of machine learning technologies. The project has crucial clinical significance for risk stratification and determination of HCM patients with high risk of adverse outcomes. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: ChiCTR2300070909."
38036550,Yes,Yes,No,No,Genome-wide association analysis of left ventricular imaging-derived phenotypes identifies 72 risk loci and yields genetic insights into hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Left ventricular regional wall thickness (LVRWT) is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). To identify specific genetic influences on individual LVRWT, we established a novel deep learning algorithm to calculate 12 LVRWTs accurately in 42,194 individuals from the UK Biobank with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Genome-wide association studies of CMR-derived 12 LVRWTs identified 72 significant genetic loci associated with at least one LVRWT phenotype (P < 5 x 10(-8)), which were revealed to actively participate in heart development and contraction pathways. Significant causal relationships were observed between the LVRWT traits and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses (P < 0.01). The polygenic risk score of inferoseptal LVRWT at end systole exhibited a notable association with incident HCM, facilitating the identification of high-risk individuals. The findings yield insights into the genetic determinants of LVRWT phenotypes and shed light on the biological basis for HCM etiology."
38014537,Yes,Yes,No,No,Genotype-Phenotype Taxonomy of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important cause of sudden cardiac death associated with heterogeneous phenotypes, but there is no systematic framework for classifying morphology or assessing associated risks. Here, we quantitatively survey genotype-phenotype associations in HCM to derive a data-driven taxonomy of disease expression. METHODS: We enrolled 436 patients with HCM (median age, 60 years; 28.8% women) with clinical, genetic, and imaging data. An independent cohort of 60 patients with HCM from Singapore (median age, 59 years; 11% women) and a reference population from the UK Biobank (n=16 691; mean age, 55 years; 52.5% women) were also recruited. We used machine learning to analyze the 3-dimensional structure of the left ventricle from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and build a tree-based classification of HCM phenotypes. Genotype and mortality risk distributions were projected on the tree. RESULTS: Carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for HCM had lower left ventricular mass, but greater basal septal hypertrophy, with reduced life span (mean follow-up, 9.9 years) compared with genotype negative individuals (hazard ratio, 2.66 [95% CI, 1.42-4.96]; P<0.002). Four main phenotypic branches were identified using unsupervised learning of 3-dimensional shape: (1) nonsarcomeric hypertrophy with coexisting hypertension; (2) diffuse and basal asymmetrical hypertrophy associated with outflow tract obstruction; (3) isolated basal hypertrophy; and (4) milder nonobstructive hypertrophy enriched for familial sarcomeric HCM (odds ratio for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.93-2.28]; P=0.0001). Polygenic risk for HCM was also associated with different patterns and degrees of disease expression. The model was generalizable to an independent cohort (trustworthiness, M(1): 0.86-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: We report a data-driven taxonomy of HCM for identifying groups of patients with similar morphology while preserving a continuum of disease severity, genetic risk, and outcomes. This approach will be of value in understanding the causes and consequences of disease diversity."
38006610,Yes,Yes,No,No,Prediction of diagnostic gene biomarkers for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by integrated machine learning.,"OBJECTIVES: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a leading cause of heart failure and sudden death, requires early diagnosis and treatment. This study investigated the underlying pathogenesis and explored potential diagnostic gene biomarkers for HCM. METHODS: Transcriptional profiles of myocardial tissues from patients with HCM (dataset GSE36961) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and subjected to bioinformatics analyses, including differentially expressed gene (DEG) identification, enrichment analyses, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and support vector machine recursive feature elimination were performed to identify candidate diagnostic gene biomarkers. mRNA expression levels of candidate biomarkers were tested in an external dataset (GSE141910); area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values were obtained to validate diagnostic efficacy. RESULTS: Overall, 156 DEGs (109 downregulated, 47 upregulated) were identified. Enrichment and PPI network analyses indicated that the DEGs were involved in biological functions and molecular pathways including inflammatory response, platelet activity, complement and coagulation cascades, extracellular matrix organization, phagosome, apoptosis, and VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling. RASD1, CDC42EP4, MYH6, and FCN3 were identified as diagnostic biomarkers for HCM. CONCLUSIONS: RASD1, CDC42EP4, MYH6, and FCN3 might be diagnostic gene biomarkers for HCM and can provide insights concerning HCM pathogenesis."
37820551,Yes,Yes,No,No,Impact of a Center of Excellence in Confirming or Excluding a Diagnosis of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"Tertiary hospitals with expertise in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are assuming a greater role in confirming and correcting HCM diagnoses at referring centers. The objectives were to establish the frequency of alternate diagnoses from referring centers and identify predictors of accuracy of an HCM diagnosis from the referring centers. Imaging findings from echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in 210 patients referred to an HCM Center of Excellence between September 2020 and October 2022 were reviewed. Clinical and imaging characteristics from pre-referral studies were used to construct a model for predictors of ruling out HCM or confirming the diagnosis using machine learning methods (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression). Alternative diagnoses were found in 38 of the 210 patients (18.1%) (median age 60 years, 50% female). A total of 17 of the 38 patients (44.7%) underwent a new CMR after their initial visit, and 14 of 38 patients (36.8%) underwent review of a previous CMR. Increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume, indexed, greater septal thickness measurements, greater left atrial size, asymmetric hypertrophy on echocardiography, and the presence of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator were associated with higher odds ratios for confirming a diagnosis of HCM, whereas increasing age and the presence of diabetes were more predictive of rejecting a diagnosis of HCM (area under the curve 0.902, p <0.0001). In conclusion, >1 in 6 patients with presumed HCM were found to have an alternate diagnosis after review at an HCM Center of Excellence, and both clinical findings and imaging parameters predicted an alternate diagnosis."
37714095,Yes,Yes,No,No,Natural Language Processing for the Ascertainment and Phenotyping of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy on Echocardiogram Reports.,"Extracting and accurately phenotyping electronic health documentation is critical for medical research and clinical care. We sought to develop a highly accurate and open-source natural language processing (NLP) module to ascertain and phenotype left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) diagnoses from echocardiogram reports within a diverse hospital network. After the initial development on 17,250 echocardiogram reports, 700 unique reports from 6 hospitals were randomly selected from data repositories within the Mass General Brigham healthcare system and manually adjudicated by physicians for 10 subtypes of LVH and diagnoses of HCM. Using an open-source NLP system, the module was formally tested on 300 training set reports and validated on 400 reports. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated to assess the discriminative accuracy of the NLP module. The NLP demonstrated robust performance across the 10 LVH subtypes, with the overall sensitivity and specificity exceeding 96%. In addition, the NLP module demonstrated excellent performance in detecting HCM diagnoses, with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 93%. In conclusion, we designed a highly accurate NLP module to determine the presence of LVH and HCM on echocardiogram reports. Our work demonstrates the feasibility and accuracy of NLP to detect diagnoses on imaging reports, even when described in free text. This module has been placed in the public domain to advance research, trial recruitment, and population health management for patients with LVH-associated conditions."
37431848,Yes,Yes,No,No,Deep Learning for Discrimination of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Hypertensive Heart Disease on MRI Native T1 Maps.,"BACKGROUND: Native T1 and radiomics were used for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and hypertensive heart disease (HHD) differentiation previously. The current problem is that global native T1 remains modest discrimination performance and radiomics requires feature extraction beforehand. Deep learning (DL) is a promising technique in differential diagnosis. However, its feasibility for discriminating HCM and HHD has not been investigated. PURPOSE: To examine the feasibility of DL in differentiating HCM and HHD based on T1 images and compare its diagnostic performance with other methods. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: 128 HCM patients (men, 75; age, 50 years +/- 16) and 59 HHD patients (men, 40; age, 45 years +/- 17). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T; Balanced steady-state free precession, phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) and multislice native T1 mapping. ASSESSMENT: Compare HCM and HHD patients baseline data. Myocardial T1 values were extracted from native T1 images. Radiomics was implemented through feature extraction and Extra Trees Classifier. The DL network is ResNet32. Different input including myocardial ring (DL-myo), myocardial ring bounding box (DL-box) and the surrounding tissue without myocardial ring (DL-nomyo) were tested. We evaluate diagnostic performance through AUC of ROC curve. STATISTICAL TESTS: Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC, and AUC were calculated. Independent t test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were adopted for HCM and HHD comparison. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: DL-myo, DL-box, and DL-nomyo models showed an AUC (95% confidential interval) of 0.830 (0.702-0.959), 0.766 (0.617-0.915), 0.795 (0.654-0.936) in the testing set. AUC of native T1 and radiomics were 0.545 (0.352-0.738) and 0.800 (0.655-0.944) in the testing set. DATA CONCLUSION: The DL method based on T1 mapping seems capable of discriminating HCM and HHD. Considering diagnostic performance, the DL network outperformed the native T1 method. Compared with radiomics, DL won an advantage for its high specificity and automated working mode. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2."
37391825,Yes,Yes,No,No,Characterization of the circulating transcriptome expression profile and identification of novel miRNA biomarkers in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), one of the most common genetic cardiovascular diseases, but cannot be explained by single genetic factors. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are stable and highly conserved. Inflammation and immune response participate in HCM pathophysiology, but whether the miRNA profile changes correspondingly in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with HCM is unclear. Herein, we aimed to investigate the circulating non-coding RNA (ncRNA) expression profile in PBMCs and identify potential miRNAs for HCM biomarkers. METHODS: A Custom CeRNA Human Gene Expression Microarray was used to identify differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, miRNAs, and ncRNAs (including circRNA and lncRNA) in HCM PBMCs. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify HCM-related miRNA and mRNA modules. The mRNAs and miRNAs from the key modules were used to construct a co-expression network. Three separate machine learning algorithms (random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression) were applied to identify potential biomarkers based on miRNAs from the HCM co-expression network. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE188324) and experimental samples were used for further verification. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was used to determine the potential functions of the selected miRNAs in HCM. RESULTS: We identified 1194 DE-mRNAs, 232 DE-miRNAs and 7696 DE-ncRNAs in HCM samples compared with normal controls from the microarray data sets. WGCNA identified key miRNA modules and mRNA modules evidently associated with HCM. We constructed a miRNA‒mRNA co-expression network based on these modules. A total of three hub miRNAs (miR-924, miR-98 and miR-1) were identified by random forest, and the areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves of miR-924, miR-98 and miR-1 were 0.829, 0.866, and 0.866, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We elucidated the transcriptome expression profile in PBMCs and identified three hub miRNAs (miR-924, miR-98 and miR-1) as potential biomarkers for HCM detection."
37180214,Yes,Yes,No,No,Refractory electrical storm in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.,"A 63-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), mid-ventricular obstruction, and an apical aneurysm had an episode of cardiac arrest due to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). He was resuscitated and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted. In the following years, several episodes of VT and ventricular fibrillation were successfully terminated by antitachycardia pacing or ICD shocks. Three years after ICD implantation, he was re-admitted because of refractory electrical storm (ES). Since aggressive pharmacological treatments, direct current cardioversions, and deep sedation were not effective, he underwent epicardial catheter ablation which was successful to terminate ES. However, because of the recurrence of refractory ES after one year, he proceeded to surgical left ventricular myectomy with apical aneurysmectomy which provided him a relatively stable clinical course for six years. Although epicardial catheter ablation may be an acceptable option, surgical resection of apical aneurysm seems to be most efficacious for ES in patients with HCM and an apical aneurysm. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are the gold standard of therapy for prophylaxis against sudden death. Electrical storm (ES) caused by recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia can cause sudden death even in patients with ICDs. Although epicardial catheter ablation may be an acceptable option, surgical resection of apical aneurysm is most efficacious for ES in patients with HCM, mid-ventricular obstruction, and an apical aneurysm."
37174935,Yes,Yes,No,No,Papillary-Muscle-Derived Radiomic Features for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy versus Hypertensive Heart Disease Classification.,"Purpose: This study aimed to assess the value of radiomic features derived from the myocardium (MYO) and papillary muscle (PM) for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) detection and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) versus hypertensive heart disease (HHD) differentiation. Methods: There were 345 subjects who underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) examinations that were analyzed. After quality control and manual segmentation, the 3D radiomic features were extracted from the MYO and PM. The data were randomly split into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. Feature selection was performed on the training dataset. Five machine learning models were evaluated using the MYO, PM, and MYO+PM features in the detection and differentiation tasks. The optimal differentiation model was further evaluated using CMR parameters and combined features. Results: Six features were selected for the MYO, PM, and MYO+PM groups. The support vector machine models performed best in both the detection and differentiation tasks. For LVH detection, the highest area under the curve (AUC) was 0.966 in the MYO group. For HCM vs. HHD differentiation, the best AUC was 0.935 in the MYO+PM group. Comparing the radiomics models to the CMR parameter models for the differentiation tasks, the radiomics models achieved significantly improved the performance (p = 0.002). Conclusions: The radiomics model with the MYO+PM features showed similar performance to the models developed from the MYO features in the detection task, but outperformed the models developed from the MYO or PM features in the differentiation task. In addition, the radiomic models performed better than the CMR parameters' models."
37121957,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine learning modeling identifies hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtypes with genetic signature.,"Previous studies have revealed that patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) exhibit differences in symptom severity and prognosis, indicating potential HCM subtypes among these patients. Here, 793 patients with HCM were recruited at an average follow-up of 32.78 +/- 27.58 months to identify potential HCM subtypes by performing consensus clustering on the basis of their echocardiography features. Furthermore, we proposed a systematic method for illustrating the relationship between the phenotype and genotype of each HCM subtype by using machine learning modeling and interactome network detection techniques based on whole-exome sequencing data. Another independent cohort that consisted of 414 patients with HCM was recruited to replicate the findings. Consequently, two subtypes characterized by different clinical outcomes were identified in HCM. Patients with subtype 2 presented asymmetric septal hypertrophy associated with a stable course, while those with subtype 1 displayed left ventricular systolic dysfunction and aggressive progression. Machine learning modeling based on personal whole-exome data identified 46 genes with mutation burden that could accurately predict subtype propensities. Furthermore, the patients in another cohort predicted as subtype 1 by the 46-gene model presented increased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. By employing echocardiography and genetic screening for the 46 genes, HCM can be classified into two subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes."
37115813,Yes,Yes,No,No,Imaging of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current article reviews obstructive forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and associated morphologic cardiac abnormalities. It focuses on echocardiographic imaging of the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction, its evaluation, prognostication, and differentiation from other conditions mimicking obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. RECENT FINDINGS: Symptomatic patients with LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradients at least 50 mmHg on maximally tolerated medical therapy are candidates for advanced therapies. Resting echocardiography may only identify 30% of patients with obstructive physiology. Provocative maneuvers are essential for symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Exercise echocardiography is recommended if they fail to provoke a gradient. Although dynamic LV tract obstruction is seen with obstructive HCM, it is not specific to this condition and exists in other physiologic and pathophysiologic states. Careful clinical evaluation and imaging techniques aid in the differentiation of HCM from these conditions. SUMMARY: Imaging plays an integral role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and risk stratification of HCM patients. Newer imaging technologies, including 3D transthoracic echocardiography, 3D transesophageal, speckle-derived 2D strain, and cardiac MRI, allow for a better hemodynamic understanding of systolic anterior motion and LV tract obstruction. Evolving techniques, that is, artificial intelligence, will undoubtedly further increase diagnostic capabilities. Newer medical therapies are available with the hope that this will lead to better patient management."
36835444,Yes,Yes,No,No,Untargeted Metabolomics Identifies Potential Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Biomarkers in Carriers of MYBPC3 Founder Variants.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most prevalent monogenic heart disease, commonly caused by pathogenic MYBPC3 variants, and a significant cause of sudden cardiac death. Severity is highly variable, with incomplete penetrance among genotype-positive family members. Previous studies demonstrated metabolic changes in HCM. We aimed to identify metabolite profiles associated with disease severity in carriers of MYBPC3 founder variants using direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry in plasma of 30 carriers with a severe phenotype (maximum wall thickness >/=20 mm, septal reduction therapy, congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, or malignant ventricular arrhythmia) and 30 age- and sex-matched carriers with no or a mild phenotype. Of the top 25 mass spectrometry peaks selected by sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis, XGBoost gradient boosted trees, and Lasso logistic regression (42 total), 36 associated with severe HCM at a p < 0.05, 20 at p < 0.01, and 3 at p < 0.001. These peaks could be clustered to several metabolic pathways, including acylcarnitine, histidine, lysine, purine and steroid hormone metabolism, and proteolysis. In conclusion, this exploratory case-control study identified metabolites associated with severe phenotypes in MYBPC3 founder variant carriers. Future studies should assess whether these biomarkers contribute to HCM pathogenesis and evaluate their contribution to risk stratification."
36812626,Yes,Yes,No,No,Interpretable machine learning for automated left ventricular scar quantification in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients.,"Scar quantification on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images is important in risk stratifying patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) due to the importance of scar burden in predicting clinical outcomes. We aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model that contours left ventricular (LV) endo- and epicardial borders and quantifies CMR LGE images from HCM patients.We retrospectively studied 2557 unprocessed images from 307 HCM patients followed at the University Health Network (Canada) and Tufts Medical Center (USA). LGE images were manually segmented by two experts using two different software packages. Using 6SD LGE intensity cutoff as the gold standard, a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on 80% and tested on the remaining 20% of the data. Model performance was evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Bland-Altman, and Pearson's correlation. The 6SD model DSC scores were good to excellent at 0.91 +/- 0.04, 0.83 +/- 0.03, and 0.64 +/- 0.09 for the LV endocardium, epicardium, and scar segmentation, respectively. The bias and limits of agreement for the percentage of LGE to LV mass were low (-0.53 +/- 2.71%), and correlation high (r = 0.92). This fully automated interpretable ML algorithm allows rapid and accurate scar quantification from CMR LGE images. This program does not require manual image pre-processing, and was trained with multiple experts and software, increasing its generalizability."
36730319,Yes,Yes,No,No,Deep learning-based diagnosis of feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common heart disease affecting 10-15% of all cats. Cats with HCM exhibit breathing difficulties, lethargy, and heart murmur; furthermore, feline HCM can also result in sudden death. Among various methods and indices, radiography and ultrasound are the gold standards in the diagnosis of feline HCM. However, only 75% accuracy has been achieved using radiography alone. Therefore, we trained five residual architectures (ResNet50V2, ResNet152, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, and Xception) using 231 ventrodorsal radiographic images of cats (143 HCM and 88 normal) and investigated the optimal architecture for diagnosing feline HCM through radiography. To ensure the generalizability of the data, the x-ray images were obtained from 5 independent institutions. In addition, 42 images were used in the test. The test data were divided into two; 22 radiographic images were used in prediction analysis and 20 radiographic images of cats were used in the evaluation of the peeking phenomenon and the voting strategy. As a result, all models showed > 90% accuracy; Resnet50V2: 95.45%; Resnet152: 95.45; InceptionResNetV2: 95.45%; MobileNetV2: 95.45% and Xception: 95.45. In addition, two voting strategies were applied to the five CNN models; softmax and majority voting. As a result, the softmax voting strategy achieved 95% accuracy in combined test data. Our findings demonstrate that an automated deep-learning system using a residual architecture can assist veterinary radiologists in screening HCM."
36676118,Yes,Yes,No,No,Multimodality Imaging in Sarcomeric Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Get It Right...on Time.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) follows highly variable paradigms and disease-specific patterns of progression towards heart failure, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Therefore, a generalized standard approach, shared with other cardiomyopathies, can be misleading in this setting. A multimodality imaging approach facilitates differential diagnosis of phenocopies and improves clinical and therapeutic management of the disease. However, only a profound knowledge of the progression patterns, including clinical features and imaging data, enables an appropriate use of all these resources in clinical practice. Combinations of various imaging tools and novel techniques of artificial intelligence have a potentially relevant role in diagnosis, clinical management and definition of prognosis. Nonetheless, several barriers persist such as unclear appropriate timing of imaging or universal standardization of measures and normal reference limits. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on multimodality imaging and potentialities of novel tools, including artificial intelligence, in the management of patients with sarcomeric HCM, highlighting the importance of specific ""red alerts"" to understand the phenotype-genotype linkage."
36671652,Yes,Yes,No,No,Collinearity and Dimensionality Reduction in Radiomics: Effect of Preprocessing Parameters in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Magnetic Resonance T1 and T2 Mapping.,"Radiomics and artificial intelligence have the potential to become a valuable tool in clinical applications. Frequently, radiomic analyses through machine learning methods present issues caused by high dimensionality and multicollinearity, and redundant radiomic features are usually removed based on correlation analysis. We assessed the effect of preprocessing-in terms of voxel size resampling, discretization, and filtering-on correlation-based dimensionality reduction in radiomic features from cardiac T1 and T2 maps of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. For different combinations of preprocessing parameters, we performed a dimensionality reduction of radiomic features based on either Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficient, followed by the computation of the stability index. With varying resampling voxel size and discretization bin width, for both T1 and T2 maps, Pearson's and Spearman's dimensionality reduction produced a slightly different percentage of remaining radiomic features, with a relatively high stability index. For different filters, the remaining features' stability was instead relatively low. Overall, the percentage of eliminated radiomic features through correlation-based dimensionality reduction was more dependent on resampling voxel size and discretization bin width for textural features than for shape or first-order features. Notably, correlation-based dimensionality reduction was less sensitive to preprocessing when considering radiomic features from T2 compared with T1 maps."
36658623,Yes,Yes,No,No,The predictive value of deep learning-based cardiac ultrasound flow imaging for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy complicating arrhythmias.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive value of deep learning-based cardiac ultrasound flow imaging for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) complicated by arrhythmias. METHODS: The clinical data of 158 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were retrospectively collected from July 2019 to December 2021, and additionally divided into training group 106 cases, validation group 26 cases and test group 26 cases according to the ratio of 4:1:1, and divided into concurrent and non-concurrent groups according to whether they were complicated by arrhythmia or not, respectively. General data of patients (age, gender, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, HR) were collected, a deep learning model for cardiac ultrasound flow imaging was established, and image data, LVEF, LAVI, E/e', vortex area change rate, circulation intensity change rate, mean blood flow velocity, and mean EL value were extracted. RESULTS: The differences in general data (age, gender, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, HR) between the three groups were not statistically significant, P > 0.05. The differences in age, gender, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, HR between the patients in the concurrent and non-concurrent groups in the training group were not statistically significant, P > 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning-based cardiac ultrasound flow imaging can identify cardiac ultrasound images more accurately and has a high predictive value for arrhythmias complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and vortex area change rate, circulation intensity change rate, mean flow velocity, mean EL, LAVI, and E/e' are all risk factors for arrhythmias complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
36645545,Yes,Yes,No,No,Quality of life and societal costs in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: protocol of the AFFECT-HCM study.,"BACKGROUND: Ever since the first description of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common genetic cardiac disease, tremendous progress has been made in the evaluation and management of HCM patients, but little attention has been focused on the impact of HCM on societal costs and quality of life (QoL). AIMS: This paper describes the study protocol for the AFFECT-HCM study into burden of disease (BoD), which aims to estimate health-related QoL and societal costs in HCM patients and genotype-positive phenotype-negative (G+/P-) relatives during a one-year follow-up study, and relate this to the phenotypical HCM expression. METHODS: A total of 400 Dutch HCM patients and 100 G+/P- subjects will be followed for one year in a prospective, multi-centre, prevalence-based BoD study. Societal costs will be measured via a bottom-up approach using the cost questionnaires iMCQ and iPCQ. For QoL, the generic EQ-5D-5L and disease-specific Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire will be used. QoL and societal costs will be compared with phenotype-specific HCM characteristics and other determinants to identify factors that influence BoD. Accelerometry will test the correlation between BoD and physical activity. CONCLUSION: The AFFECT-HCM study will evaluate the BoD in HCM patients and G+/P- subjects to improve the understanding of the societal and economic impact of HCM."
36499607,Yes,Yes,No,No,Novel Genes Involved in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Data of Transcriptome and Methylome Profiling.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart disease; its pathogenesis is still being intensively studied to explain the reasons for the significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease. To search for new genes involved in HCM development, we analyzed gene expression profiles coupled with DNA methylation profiles in the hypertrophied myocardia of HCM patients. The transcriptome analysis identified significant differences in the levels of 193 genes, most of which were underexpressed in HCM. The methylome analysis revealed 1755 nominally significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs), mostly hypomethylated in HCM. Based on gene ontology enrichment analysis, the majority of biological processes, overrepresented by both differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and DMP-containing genes, are involved in the regulation of locomotion and muscle structure development. The intersection of 193 DEGs and 978 DMP-containing genes pinpointed eight common genes, the expressions of which correlated with the methylation levels of the neighboring DMPs. Half of these genes (AUTS2, BRSK2, PRRT1, and SLC17A7), regulated by the mechanism of DNA methylation, were underexpressed in HCM and were involved in neurogenesis and synapse functioning. Our data, suggesting the involvement of innervation-associated genes in HCM, provide additional insights into disease pathogenesis and expand the field of further research."
36452351,Yes,Yes,No,No,Case Report: Novel LIM domain-binding protein 3 (LDB3) mutations associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy family.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy, which is one of the most common reasons for cardiac arrest in children or adolescents. It is characterized by ventricular hypertrophy (usually left ventricle), small ventricular cavity, and reduced ventricular diastolic compliance found by echocardiography in the absence of abnormal load (such as hypertension or aortic stenosis). HCM is usually caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere or sarcomere-related genes. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is performed to identify probable causative genes. Through WES, we identified LIM domain-binding protein 3 (LDB3) mutations (R547Q and P323S) respectively in an 11-year-old HCM girl and a 6-year-old HCM boy. Neural network analyses showed that the LDB3 (R547Q and P323S) mutation decreased its protein stability, with confidence scores of -0.9211 and -0.8967. The STRUM server also confirmed that the mutation decreased its protein stability. Thus, LDB3 mutation may be associated with heritable HCM. To our knowledge, this is the first time to report LDB3 heterozygous variants (R547Q and P323S) responsible for heritable HCM."
36441173,Yes,Yes,No,No,Left ventricular anatomy in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: beyond basal septal hypertrophy.,"AIMS: Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) is characterized by dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract (LVOT). Although this may be mediated by interplay between the hypertrophied septal wall, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and papillary muscle abnormalities, the mechanistic role of LV shape is still not fully understood. This study sought to identify the LV end-diastolic morphology underpinning oHCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance images from 2398 HCM individuals were obtained as part of the NHLBI HCM Registry. Three-dimensional LV models were constructed and used, together with a principal component analysis, to build a statistical shape model capturing shape variations. A set of linear discriminant axes were built to define and quantify (Z-scores) the characteristic LV morphology associated with LVOT obstruction (LVOTO) under different physiological conditions and the relationship between LV phenotype and genotype. The LV remodelling pattern in oHCM consisted not only of basal septal hypertrophy but a combination with LV lengthening, apical dilatation, and LVOT inward remodelling. Salient differences were observed between obstructive cases at rest and stress. Genotype negative cases showed a tendency towards more obstructive phenotypes both at rest and stress. CONCLUSIONS: LV anatomy underpinning oHCM consists of basal septal hypertrophy, apical dilatation, LV lengthening, and LVOT inward remodelling. Differences between oHCM cases at rest and stress, as well as the relationship between LV phenotype and genotype, suggest different mechanisms for LVOTO. Proposed Z-scores render an opportunity of redefining management strategies based on the relationship between LV anatomy and LVOTO."
36386316,Yes,Yes,No,No,Differentiating between cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy on non-contrast cine-magnetic resonance images using machine learning-based radiomics.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether texture analysis (TA) and machine learning-based classifications can be applied in differential diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using non-contrast cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved study, we consecutively enrolled 167 patients with CA (n = 85), HCM (n = 82), and 84 patients with normal CMR served as controls. All cases were randomized into training [119 patients (70%)] and validation [48 patients (30%)] groups. A total of 275 texture features were extracted from cine images. Based on regression analysis with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), nine machine learning models were established and their diagnostic performance determined. RESULTS: Nineteen radiomics texture features derived from cine images were used to differentiate CA and HCM. In the validation cohort, the support vector machine (SVM), which had an accuracy of 0.85, showed the best performance (MCC = 0.637). Gray level non-uniformity (GLevNonU) was the single most effective feature. The combined model of radiomics texture features and conventional MR metrics had superior discriminatory performance (AUC = 0.89) over conventional MR metrics model (AUC = 0.79). Moreover, results showed that GLevNonU levels in HCM patients were significantly higher compared with levels in CA patients and control groups (P < 0.001). A cut-off of GLevNonU >/= 25 was shown to differentiate between CA and HCM patients, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 (CI:0.804-0.920). Multiple comparisons tests showed that GLevNonU was significantly greater in LGE+, relative to LGE-patient groups (CA+ vs. CA- and HCM+ vs. HCM-, P = 0.01, 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based classifiers can accurately differentiate between CA and HCM on non-contrast cine images. The radiomics-MR combined model can be used to improve the discriminatory performance. TA may be used to assess myocardial microstructure changes that occur during different stages of cardiomyopathies."
36334102,Yes,Yes,No,No,Identification of fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a radiomic study on cardiac magnetic resonance cine imaging.,"OBJECTIVES: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) often requires repeated enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to detect fibrosis. We aimed to develop a practical model based on cine imaging to help identify patients with high risk of fibrosis and screen out patients without fibrosis to avoid unnecessary injection of contrast. METHODS: A total of 273 patients with HCM were divided into training and test sets at a ratio of 7:3. Logistic regression analysis was used to find predictive image features to construct CMR model. Radiomic features were derived from the maximal wall thickness (MWT) slice and entire left ventricular (LV) myocardium. Extreme gradient boosting was used to build radiomic models. Integrated models were established by fusing image features and radiomic models. The model performance was validated in the test set and assessed by ROC and calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: We established five prediction models, including CMR, R1 (based on the MWT slice), R2 (based on the entire LV myocardium), and two integrated models (I(CMR+R1) and I(CMR+R2)). In the test set, I(CMR+R2) model had an excellent AUC value (0.898), diagnostic accuracy (89.02%), sensitivity (92.54%), and F1 score (93.23%) in identifying patients with positive late gadolinium enhancement. The calibration plots and DCA indicated that I(CMR+R2) model was well-calibrated and presented a better net benefit than other models. CONCLUSIONS: A predictive model that fused image and radiomic features from the entire LV myocardium had good diagnostic performance, robustness, and clinical utility. KEY POINTS: * Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is prone to fibrosis, requiring patients to undergo repeated enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to detect fibrosis over their lifetime follow-up. * A predictive model based on the entire left ventricular myocardium outperformed a model based on a slice of the maximal wall thickness. * A predictive model that fused image and radiomic features from the entire left ventricular myocardium had excellent diagnostic performance, robustness, and clinical utility."
36294999,Yes,Yes,No,No,Subtypes and Mechanisms of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Proposed by Machine Learning Algorithms.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common inherited cardiac disease that results in left ventricular hypertrophy. Machine learning uses algorithms to study patterns in data and develop models able to make predictions. The aim of this study is to identify HCM subtypes and examine the mechanisms of HCM using machine learning algorithms. Clinical and laboratory findings of 143 adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of nonobstructive HCM are analyzed; HCM subtypes are determined by clustering, while the presence of different HCM features is predicted in classification machine learning tasks. Four clusters are determined as the optimal number of clusters for this dataset. Models that can predict the presence of particular HCM features from other genotypic and phenotypic information are generated, and subsets of features sufficient to predict the presence of other features of HCM are determined. This research proposes four subtypes of HCM assessed by machine learning algorithms and based on the overall phenotypic expression of the participants of the study. The identified subsets of features sufficient to determine the presence of particular HCM aspects could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of HCM."
36260236,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine learning algorithms to automate differentiating cardiac amyloidosis from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Cardiac amyloidosis has a poor prognosis, and high mortality and is often misdiagnosed as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, leading to delayed diagnosis. Machine learning combined with speckle tracking echocardiography was proposed to automate differentiating two conditions. A total of 74 patients with pathologically confirmed monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain cardiac amyloidosis and 64 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were enrolled from June 2015 to November 2018. Machine learning models utilizing traditional and advanced algorithms were established and determined the most significant predictors. The performance was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC). With clinical and echocardiography data, all models showed great discriminative performance (AUC > 0.9). Compared with logistic regression (AUC 0.91), machine learning such as support vector machine (AUC 0.95, p = 0.477), random forest (AUC 0.97, p = 0.301) and gradient boosting machine (AUC 0.98, p = 0.230) demonstrated similar capability to distinguish cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. With speckle tracking echocardiography, the predictive performance of the voting model was similar to that of LightGBM (AUC was 0.86 for both), while the AUC of XGBoost was slightly lower (AUC 0.84). In fivefold cross-validation, the voting model was more robust globally and superior to the single model in some test sets. Data-driven machine learning had shown admirable performance in differentiating two conditions and could automatically integrate abundant variables to identify the most discriminating predictors without making preassumptions. In the era of big data, automated machine learning will help to identify patients with cardiac amyloidosis and timely and effectively intervene, thus improving the outcome."
36258218,Yes,Yes,No,No,Natural language processing for identification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients from cardiac magnetic resonance reports.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is important for diagnosis and risk stratification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. However, collection of information from large numbers of CMR reports by manual review is time-consuming, error-prone and costly. Natural language processing (NLP) is an artificial intelligence method for automated extraction of information from narrative text including text in CMR reports in electronic health records (EHR). Our objective was to assess whether NLP can accurately extract diagnosis of HCM from CMR reports. METHODS: An NLP system with two tiers was developed for information extraction from narrative text in CMR reports; the first tier extracted information regarding HCM diagnosis while the second extracted categorical and numeric concepts for HCM classification. We randomly allocated 200 HCM patients with CMR reports from 2004 to 2018 into training (100 patients with 185 CMR reports) and testing sets (100 patients with 206 reports). RESULTS: NLP algorithms demonstrated very high performance compared to manual annotation. The algorithm to extract HCM diagnosis had accuracy of 0.99. The accuracy for categorical concepts included HCM morphologic subtype 0.99, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve 0.96, mitral regurgitation 0.93, left ventricular (LV) obstruction 0.94, location of obstruction 0.92, apical pouch 0.98, LV delayed enhancement 0.93, left atrial enlargement 0.99 and right atrial enlargement 0.98. Accuracy for numeric concepts included maximal LV wall thickness 0.96, LV mass 0.99, LV mass index 0.98, LV ejection fraction 0.98 and right ventricular ejection fraction 0.99. CONCLUSIONS: NLP identified and classified HCM from CMR narrative text reports with very high performance."
36201099,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine learning evaluation of LV outflow obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using three-chamber cardiovascular magnetic resonance.,"Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) is common in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but relationships between anatomical metrics and obstruction are poorly understood. We aimed to develop machine learning methods to evaluate LVOTO in HCM patients and quantify relationships between anatomical metrics and obstruction. This retrospective analysis of 1905 participants of the HCM Registry quantified 11 anatomical metrics derived from 14 landmarks automatically detected on the three-chamber long axis cine CMR images. Linear and logistic regression was used to quantify strengths of relationships with the presence of LVOTO (defined by resting Doppler pressure drop of > 30 mmHg), using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC). Intraclass correlation coefficients between the network predictions and three independent observers showed similar agreement to that between observers. The distance from anterior mitral valve leaflet tip to basal septum (AML-BS) was most highly correlated with Doppler pressure drop (R(2) = 0.19, p < 10(-5)). Multivariate stepwise regression found the best predictive model included AML-BS, AML length to aortic valve diameter ratio, AML length to LV width ratio, and midventricular septal thickness metrics (AUC 0.84). Excluding AML-BS, metrics grouped according to septal hypertrophy, LV geometry, and AML anatomy each had similar associations with LVOTO (AUC 0.71, 0.71, 0.68 respectively, p = ns), significantly less than their combination (AUC 0.77, p < 0.05 for each). Anatomical metrics derived from a standard three-chamber CMR cine acquisition can be used to highlight risk of LVOTO, and suggest further investigation if necessary. A combination of geometric factors is required to provide the best risk prediction."
36157891,Yes,Yes,No,No,The Establishment of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Diagnosis Model via Artificial Neural Network and Random Decision Forest Method.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a hereditary disease characterized by asymmetric ventricular hypertrophy as the key anatomical feature. Currently, there exists no effective method for the early diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In this analysis, we incorporated multiple GEO datasets containing RNA profiles of hypertrophic cardiomyopathic patient tissues, identified 642 differentially expressed genes, and performed GO and KEGG analyses. Furthermore, we narrowed down 46 characteristic genes from these differentially expressed genes using random decision forests and conducted transcription factor regulation analysis on them. Using 40 genes that showed overlap between the training set and the verification set, the artificial neural network was trained, and the final MPS scoring model was constructed, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn. We used the MPS model to predict the verification dataset and drew the ROC curve, which demonstrated the good prediction performance of the model. In conclusion, this study combines a random decision forest and artificial neural network to build a diagnostic model for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to predict the disease, aiming at early detection and treatment, prolonging the survival time, and improving the quality of life of patients."
35761339,Yes,Yes,No,No,Radiomics and deep learning for myocardial scar screening in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial scar burden quantified using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), has important prognostic value in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, nearly 50% of HCM patients have no scar but undergo repeated gadolinium-based CMR over their life span. We sought to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening model using radiomics and deep learning (DL) features extracted from balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) cine sequences to identify HCM patients without scar. METHODS: We evaluated three AI-based screening models using bSSFP cine image features extracted by radiomics, DL, or combined DL-Radiomics. Images for 759 HCM patients (50 +/- 16 years, 66% men) in a multi-center/vendor study were used to develop and test model performance. An external dataset of 100 HCM patients (53 +/- 14 years, 70% men) was used to assess model generalizability. Model performance was evaluated using area-under-receiver-operating curve (AUC). RESULTS: The DL-Radiomics model demonstrated higher AUC compared to DL and Radiomics in the internal (0.83 vs 0.77, p = 0.006 and 0.78, p = 0.05; n = 159) and external (0.74 vs 0.64, p = 0.006 and 0.71, p = 0.27; n = 100) datasets. The DL-Radiomics model correctly identified 43% and 28% of patients without scar in the internal and external datasets compared to 42% and 16% by Radiomics model and 42% and 23% by DL model, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A DL-Radiomics AI model using bSSFP cine images outperforms DL or Radiomics models alone as a scar screening tool prior to gadolinium administration. Despite its potential, the clinical utility of the model remains limited and further investigation is needed to improve the accuracy and generalizability."
35597906,Yes,Yes,No,No,Texture analysis of T2-weighted cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to discriminate between cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: To elucidate the value of texture analysis (TA) in detecting and differentiating myocardial tissue alterations on T2-weighted CMR (cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging) in patients with cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS: In this retrospective study, 100 CA (58.5 +/- 10.7 years; 41 (41%) females) and 217 HCM (50.7 +/- 14.8 years, 101 (46.5%) females) patients who underwent CMR scans were included. Regions of interest for TA were delineated by two radiologists independently on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). Stepwise dimension reduction and texture feature selection based on reproducibility, machine learning algorithms, and correlation analyses were performed to select features. Both the CA and HCM groups were randomly divided into a training dataset and a testing dataset (7:3). After the TA model was established in the training set, the diagnostic performance of the model was validated in the testing set and further validated in a subgroup of patients with similar hypertrophy. RESULTS: The 7 independent texture features provided, in combination, a diagnostic accuracy of 86.0% (AUC = 0.915; 95% CI 0.879-0.951) in the training dataset and 79.2% (AUC = 0.842; 95% CI 0.759-0.924) in the testing dataset. The differential diagnostic accuracy in the similar hypertrophy subgroup was 82.2% (AUC = 0.864, 95% CI 0.805-0.922). The significance of the difference between the AUCs of the TA model and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was verified by Delong's test (p = 0.898). All seven texture features showed significant differences between CA and HCM (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that texture analysis based on T2-weighted images could feasibly differentiate CA from HCM, even in patients with similar hypertrophy. The selected final texture features could achieve a comparable diagnostic capacity to the quantification of LGE. Trial registration Since this study is a retrospective observational study and no intervention had been involved, trial registration is waived."
39195941,Yes,Yes,No,No,Metabolic characterization of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in human heart.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited cardiovascular disease with heterogeneous clinical presentations, governed by multiple molecular mechanisms. Metabolic perturbations underlie most cardiovascular diseases; however, the metabolic alterations and their function in HCM are unknown. Here, we describe the metabolome and lipidome of heart and plasma samples from individuals with and without HCM. Correlation analyses showed strong association between metabolic alterations and cardiac function and prognosis of patients with HCM. Using machine learning we identified metabolite panels as potential HCM diagnostic markers or predictors of survival. Clustering based on metabolome and lipidome of heart enabled stratification of patients with HCM into three subgroups with distinct cardiac function and survival. Integration of metabolomics and proteomics data identified metabolic pathways significantly altered in patients with HCM, with the pentose phosphate pathway and oxidative stress being particularly upregulated. Thus, targeting the pentose phosphate pathway and oxidative stress may serve as potential therapeutic strategies for HCM."
35463194,Yes,Yes,No,No,NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING BASED MACHINE LEARNING MODEL USING CARDIAC MRI REPORTS TO IDENTIFY HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY PATIENTS.,"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease in the US and is known to cause sudden death (SCD) in young adults. While significant advancements have been made in HCM diagnosis and management, there is a need to identify HCM cases from electronic health record (EHR) data to develop automated tools based on natural language processing guided machine learning (ML) models for accurate HCM case identification to improve management and reduce adverse outcomes of HCM patients. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Imaging, plays a significant role in HCM diagnosis and risk stratification. CMR reports, generated by clinician annotation, offer rich data in the form of cardiac measurements as well as narratives describing interpretation and phenotypic description. The purpose of this study is to develop an NLP-based interpretable model utilizing impressions extracted from CMR reports to automatically identify HCM patients. CMR reports of patients with suspected HCM diagnosis between the years 1995 to 2019 were used in this study. Patients were classified into three categories of yes HCM, no HCM and, possible HCM. A random forest (RF) model was developed to predict the performance of both CMR measurements and impression features to identify HCM patients. The RF model yielded an accuracy of 86% (608 features) and 85% (30 features). These results offer promise for accurate identification of HCM patients using CMR reports from EHR for efficient clinical management transforming health care delivery for these patients."
35459726,Yes,Yes,No,No,Changing concepts in heart muscle disease: the evolving understanding of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Sixty years ago, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was considered a rare lethal disease that affected predominantly young adults and for which there were few treatment options. Today, it is recognised to be a relatively common disorder that presents throughout the life course with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype that can be managed effectively in the majority of individuals. A greater awareness of the condition and less reluctance from healthcare practitioners to make the diagnosis, coupled with improvements in cardiac imaging, including greater use of artificial intelligence and improved yields from screening efforts, have all helped facilitate a more precise and timely diagnosis. This enhanced ability to diagnose HCM early is being paired with innovations in treatment, which means that the majority of patients receiving a contemporary diagnosis of HCM can anticipate a normal life expectancy and expect to maintain a good functional status and quality of life. Indeed, with increasing translation of molecular genetics from bench to bedside associated with a growing number of randomised clinical trials of novel therapies aimed at ameliorating or perhaps even preventing the disease, the next chapter in the story for HCM will provide much excitement and more importantly, offer much anticipated reward for our patients."
35399032,Yes,Yes,No,No,[Myocardial biopsy of Liwen procedure: representability and etiological diagnostic value of cardiac samples obtained by a novel technique in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy].,"Objective: To investigate the representability and etiological diagnostic value of myocardium samples obtained from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) by transthoracic echocardiography-guided percutaneous intramyocardial septal biopsy (myocardial biopsy of Liwen procedure). Methods: This study was a retrospective case-series analysis. Patients with HCM, who underwent myocardial biopsy of Liwen procedure and radiofrequency ablation in Xijing Hospital, Air Force Military Medical University from July to December 2019, were included. Demographic data (age, sex), echocardiographic data and complications were collected through electronic medical record system. The histological and echocardiographic features, pathological characteristics of the biopsied myocardium of the patients were analyzed. Results: A total of 21 patients (aged (51.2+/-14.5) years and 13 males (61.9%)) were enrolled. The thickness of ventricular septum was (23.3+/-4.5)mm and the left ventricular outflow tract gradient was (78.8+/-42.6)mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa). Eight patients (38.1%) were complicated with hypertension, 1 patient (4.8%) had diabetes, and 2 patients (9.5%) had atrial fibrillation. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of myocardial samples of HCM patients before radiofrequency ablation evidenced myocytes hypertrophy, myocytes disarray, nuclear hyperchromatism, hypertrophy, atypia, coronary microvessel abnormalities, adipocyte infiltration, inflammatory cell infiltration, cytoplasmic vacuoles, lipofuscin deposition. Interstitial fibrosis and replacement fibrosis were detected in Masson stained biopsy samples. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of myocardial samples of HCM patients after radiofrequency ablation showed significantly reduced myocytes, cracked nuclear in myocytes, coagulative necrosis, border disappearance and nuclear fragmentation. Quantitative analysis of myocardial specimens of HCM patients before radiofrequency ablation showed that there were 9 cases (42.9%) with mild myocardial hypertrophy and 12 cases (57.1%) with severe myocardial hypertrophy. Mild, moderate and severe fibrosis were 5 (23.8%), 9 (42.9%) and 7 (33.3%), respectively. Six cases (28.6%) had myocytes disarray. There were 11 cases (52.4%) of coronary microvessel abnormalities, 4 cases (19.0%) of adipocyte infiltration, 2 cases (9.5%) of inflammatory cell infiltration,6 cases (28.5%) of cytoplasmic vacuole, 16 cases (76.2%) of lipofuscin deposition. The diameter of cardiac myocytes was (25.2+/-2.8)mum, and the percentage of collagen fiber area was 5.2%(3.0%, 14.6%). One patient had severe replacement fibrosis in the myocardium, with a fibrotic area of 67.0%. The rest of the patients had interstitial fibrosis. The myocardial specimens of 13 patients were examined by transmission electron microscopy. All showed increased myofibrils, and 9 cases had disorder of myofibrils. All patients had irregular shape of myocardial nucleus, partial depression, mild mitochondrial swelling, fracture and reduction of mitochondrial crest, and local aggregation of myofibrillary interfascicles. One patient had hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes, but the arrangement of muscle fibers was roughly normal. There were vacuoles in the cytoplasm, and Periodic acid-Schiff staining was positive. Transmission electron microscopy showed large range of glycogen deposition in the cytoplasm, with occasional double membrane surround, which was highly indicative of glycogen storage disease. No deposition of glycolipid substance in lysozyme was observed under transmission electron microscope in all myocardial specimens, which could basically eliminate Fabry disease. No apple green substance was found under polarized light after Congo red staining, which could basically exclude cardiac amyloidosis. Conclusion: Myocardium biopsied samples obtained by Liwen procedure of HCM patients are representative and helpful for the etiological diagnosis of HCM."
35351822,Yes,Yes,No,No,Proteomics profiling reveals a distinct high-risk molecular subtype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"OBJECTIVE: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heterogeneous disease, likely encompassing several subtypes of disease with distinct biological mechanisms (ie, molecular subtypes). Current models based solely on clinical data have yielded limited accuracy in predicting the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Our aim in this study was to derive molecular subtypes in our multicentre prospective cohort of patients with HCM using proteomics profiling and to examine their longitudinal associations with MACE. METHODS: We applied unsupervised machine learning methods to plasma proteomics profiling data of 1681 proteins from 258 patients with HCM who were prospectively followed for a median of 2.8 years. The primary outcome was MACE, defined as a composite of arrhythmia, heart failure, stroke and sudden cardiac death. RESULTS: We identified four molecular subtypes of HCM. Time-to-event analysis revealed significant differences in MACE-free survival among the four molecular subtypes (p(logrank)=0.007). Compared with the reference group with the lowest risk of MACE (molecular subtype A), patients in molecular subtype D had a higher risk of subsequently developing MACE, with an HR of 3.41 (95% CI 1.54 to 7.55, p=0.003). Pathway analysis of proteins differentially regulated in molecular subtype D demonstrated an upregulation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase and associated pathways, as well as pathways related to inflammation and fibrosis (eg, transforming growth factor-beta pathway). CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective plasma proteomics study not only exhibited the presence of HCM molecular subtypes but also identified pathobiological mechanisms associated with a distinct high-risk subtype of HCM."
35107432,Yes,Yes,No,No,Disease Progression of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Modeling Using Machine Learning.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disorders in general are responsible for 30% of deaths worldwide. Among them, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiac disease that is present in about 1 of 500 young adults and can cause sudden cardiac death (SCD). OBJECTIVE: Although the current state-of-the-art methods model the risk of SCD for patients, to the best of our knowledge, no methods are available for modeling the patient's clinical status up to 10 years ahead. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based tool for predicting disease progression for patients diagnosed with HCM in terms of adverse remodeling of the heart during a 10-year period. METHODS: The method consisted of 6 predictive regression models that independently predict future values of 6 clinical characteristics: left atrial size, left atrial volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association functional classification, left ventricular internal diastolic diameter, and left ventricular internal systolic diameter. We supplemented each prediction with the explanation that is generated using the Shapley additive explanation method. RESULTS: The final experiments showed that predictive error is lower on 5 of the 6 constructed models in comparison to experts (on average, by 0.34) or a consortium of experts (on average, by 0.22). The experiments revealed that semisupervised learning and the artificial data from virtual patients help improve predictive accuracies. The best-performing random forest model improved R(2) from 0.3 to 0.6. CONCLUSIONS: By engaging medical experts to provide interpretation and validation of the results, we determined the models' favorable performance compared to the performance of experts for 5 of 6 targets."
35084208,Yes,Yes,No,No,"Artificial intelligence study on left ventricular function among normal individuals, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy patients using 1.5T cardiac cine MR images obtained by SSFP sequence.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of a deep learning-based method to automatically quantify left ventricular (LV) function from MR images in different cardiomyopathy. METHODS: This retrospective study included MRI data sets from 2013 to 2020. Data on left ventricular function from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and healthy participants were analyzed. MRI data from a total of 388 patients were measured manually and automatically.The performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was evaluated based on the manual notes of two experienced observers: (a) LV segmentation accuracy, and (b) LV functional parameter accuracy. Bland-Altman analysis, Receiver operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Pearson correlation analysis were used to evaluate the consistency between fully automatic and manual diagnosis of HCM and DCM. RESULTS: The deep-learning CNN performed best in HCM in evaluating LV function and worst in DCM. Compared with manual analysis, four parameters of LV function in the HCM group showed high correlation (r at least >0.901), and the correlation of DCM in all parameters was weaker than that of HCM, especially EF (r(2) = 0.776) and SV (r(2) = 0.645). ROC curve analysis indicated that at the optimal cut-off value, EF from automatic segmentation identified DCM and HCM patients with sensitivity of 92.31 and 78.05%, specificity of 82.96 and 54.07%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Among different heart diseases, the analysis of cardiac function based on deep-learning CNN may have different performances, with DCM performing the worst and HCM the best and thus, special attention should be paid to DCM patients when assessing LV function through artificial intelligence method. LV function parameter obtained by artificial intelligence method may play an important role in the future AI diagnosis of HCM and DCM. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: These data for the first time objectively evaluate the performance of a commercially available deep learning-based method in cardiac function evaluation of different cardiomyopathy and point out its advantages and disadvantages in different cardiomyopathy. This work did not attempt to design the algorithm itself, but rather applied an already existing method to a test dataset of clinical data and evaluated the results for a limited number of cardiomyopathy."
34957254,Yes,Yes,No,No,Radiomics Analysis Derived From LGE-MRI Predict Sudden Cardiac Death in Participants With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"Objectives: To identify significant radiomics features derived from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images in participants with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and assess their prognostic value in predicting sudden cardiac death (SCD) endpoint. Method: The 157 radiomic features of 379 sequential participants with HCM who underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were extracted. CoxNet (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Elastic Net) and Random Forest models were applied to optimize feature selection for the SCD risk prediction and cross-validation was performed. Results: During a median follow-up of 29 months (interquartile range, 20-42 months), 27 participants with HCM experienced SCD events. Cox analysis revealed that two selected features, local binary patterns (LBP) (19) (hazard ratio (HR), 1.028, 95% CI: 1.032-1.134; P = 0.001) and Moment (1) (HR, 1.212, 95%CI: 1.032-1.423; P = 0.02) provided significant prognostic value to predict the SCD endpoints after adjustment for the clinical risk predictors and late gadolinium enhancement. Furthermore, the univariately significant risk predictor was improved by the addition of the selected radiomics features, LBP (19) and Moment (1), to predict SCD events (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The radiomics features of LBP (19) and Moment (1) extracted from LGE images, reflecting scar heterogeneity, have independent prognostic value in identifying high SCD risk patients with HCM."
34891607,Yes,Yes,No,No,Variational Gaussian Mixture Models with robust Dirichlet concentration priors for virtual population generation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a comparison study.,"Nowadays, there is a growing need for the development of computationally efficient virtual population generators for large-scale in-silico clinical trials. In this work, we utilize the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with variational Bayesian inference (BGMM) using robust estimations of Dirichlet concentration priors for the generation of virtual populations. The estimations were based on an exponential transformation of the number of Gaussian components. The proposed method was compared against state-of-the-art virtual data generators, such as, the Bayesian networks, the supervised tree ensembles (STE), the unsupervised tree ensembles (UTE), and the artificial neural networks (ANN) towards the generation of 20000 virtual patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Our results suggest that the proposed BGMM can yield virtual distributions with small inter- and intra-correlation difference (0.013 and 0.012), in lower execution time (4.321 sec) than STE which achieved the second-best performance."
34880319,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine learning of native T1 mapping radiomics for classification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotypes.,"We explored whether radiomic features from T1 maps by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) could enhance the diagnostic value of T1 mapping in distinguishing health from disease and classifying cardiac disease phenotypes. A total of 149 patients (n = 30 with no heart disease, n = 30 with LVH, n = 61 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and n = 28 with cardiac amyloidosis) undergoing a CMR scan were included in this study. We extracted a total of 850 radiomic features and explored their value in disease classification. We applied principal component analysis and unsupervised clustering in exploratory analysis, and then machine learning for feature selection of the best radiomic features that maximized the diagnostic value for cardiac disease classification. The first three principal components of the T1 radiomics were distinctively correlated with cardiac disease type. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the population by myocardial T1 radiomics was significantly associated with myocardial disease type (chi(2) = 55.98, p < 0.0001). After feature selection, internal validation and external testing, a model of T1 radiomics had good diagnostic performance (AUC 0.753) for multinomial classification of disease phenotype (normal vs. LVH vs. HCM vs. cardiac amyloid). A subset of six radiomic features outperformed mean native T1 values for classification between myocardial health vs. disease and HCM phenocopies (AUC of T1 vs. radiomics model, for normal: 0.549 vs. 0.888; for LVH: 0.645 vs. 0.790; for HCM 0.541 vs. 0.638; and for cardiac amyloid 0.769 vs. 0.840). We show that myocardial texture assessed by native T1 maps is linked to features of cardiac disease. Myocardial radiomic phenotyping could enhance the diagnostic yield of T1 mapping for myocardial disease detection and classification."
34831173,Yes,Yes,No,No,Distinct Metabolomic Signatures in Preclinical and Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited heart disease with poor risk prediction due to incomplete penetrance and a lack of clear genotype-phenotype correlations. Advanced imaging techniques have shown altered myocardial energetics already in preclinical gene variant carriers. To determine whether disturbed myocardial energetics with the potential to serve as biomarkers are also reflected in the serum metabolome, we analyzed the serum metabolome of asymptomatic carriers in comparison to healthy controls and obstructive HCM patients (HOCM). We performed non-quantitative direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics on serum from fasted asymptomatic gene variant carriers, symptomatic HOCM patients and healthy controls (n = 31, 14 and 9, respectively). Biomarker panels that discriminated the groups were identified by performing multivariate modeling with gradient-boosting classifiers. For all three group-wise comparisons we identified a panel of 30 serum metabolites that best discriminated the groups. These metabolite panels performed equally well as advanced cardiac imaging modalities in distinguishing the groups. Seven metabolites were found to be predictive in two different comparisons and may play an important role in defining the disease stage. This study reveals unique metabolic signatures in serum of preclinical carriers and HOCM patients that may potentially be used for HCM risk stratification and precision therapeutics."
34622599,Yes,Yes,No,No,[Early Assessment of Myocardial Fibrosis of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy with Native-T1-Mapping-Based Deep Learning: A Preliminary Study].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the diagnostic performance of deep learning (DL) model in early detection of the interstitial myocardial fibrosis using native T1 maps of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) without late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). METHODS: Sixty HCM patients and 44 healthy volunteers who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance were enrolled in this study. Each native T1 map was labeled according to its LGE status. Then, native T1 maps of LGE (-) and those of the controls were preprocessed and entered in the SE-ResNext-50 model as the matrix for the DL model for training, validation and testing. RESULTS: A total of 241 native T1 maps were entered in the SE-ResNext-50 model. The model achieved a specificity of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.79, and area under curve ( AUC) of 0.83 ( P<0.05) in distinguishing native T1 maps of LGE (-) from those of the controls in the testing set. CONCLUSION: The DL model based on SE-ResNext-50 could be used for identifying native T1 maps of LGE (-) with relatively high accuracy. It is a promising approach for early detection of myocardial fibrosis in HCM without the use of contrast agent."
34513940,Yes,Yes,No,No,Deep Learning Analysis of Echocardiographic Images to Predict Positive Genotype in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"Genetic testing provides valuable insights into family screening strategies, diagnosis, and prognosis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). On the other hand, genetic testing carries socio-economical and psychological burdens. It is therefore important to identify patients with HCM who are more likely to have positive genotype. However, conventional prediction models based on clinical and echocardiographic parameters offer only modest accuracy and are subject to intra- and inter-observer variability. We therefore hypothesized that deep convolutional neural network (DCNN, a type of deep learning) analysis of echocardiographic images improves the predictive accuracy of positive genotype in patients with HCM. In each case, we obtained parasternal short- and long-axis as well as apical 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-chamber views. We employed DCNN algorithm to predict positive genotype based on the input echocardiographic images. We performed 5-fold cross-validations. We used 2 reference models-the Mayo HCM Genotype Predictor score (Mayo score) and the Toronto HCM Genotype score (Toronto score). We compared the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) between a combined model using the reference model plus DCNN-derived probability and the reference model. We calculated the p-value by performing 1,000 bootstrapping. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). In addition, we examined the net reclassification improvement. We included 99 adults with HCM who underwent genetic testing. Overall, 45 patients (45%) had positive genotype. The new model combining Mayo score and DCNN-derived probability significantly outperformed Mayo score (AUC 0.86 [95% CI 0.79-0.93] vs. 0.72 [0.61-0.82]; p < 0.001). Similarly, the new model combining Toronto score and DCNN-derived probability exhibited a higher AUC compared to Toronto score alone (AUC 0.84 [0.76-0.92] vs. 0.75 [0.65-0.85]; p = 0.03). An improvement in the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV was also achieved, along with significant net reclassification improvement. In conclusion, compared to the conventional models, our new model combining the conventional and DCNN-derived models demonstrated superior accuracy to predict positive genotype in patients with HCM."
34503678,Yes,Yes,No,No,Phenotypic Expression and Outcomes in Individuals With Rare Genetic Variants of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by rare variants in sarcomere-encoding genes, but little is known about the clinical significance of these variants in the general population. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to compare lifetime outcomes and cardiovascular phenotypes according to the presence of rare variants in sarcomere-encoding genes among middle-aged adults. METHODS: This study analyzed whole exome sequencing and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in UK Biobank participants stratified according to sarcomere-encoding variant status. RESULTS: The prevalence of rare variants (allele frequency <0.00004) in HCM-associated sarcomere-encoding genes in 200,584 participants was 2.9% (n = 5,712; 1 in 35), and the prevalence of variants pathogenic or likely pathogenic for HCM (SARC-HCM-P/LP) was 0.25% (n = 493; 1 in 407). SARC-HCM-P/LP variants were associated with an increased risk of death or major adverse cardiac events compared with controls (hazard ratio: 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38-2.07; P < 0.001), mainly due to heart failure endpoints (hazard ratio: 4.23; 95% CI: 3.07-5.83; P < 0.001). In 21,322 participants with both cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and whole exome sequencing, SARC-HCM-P/LP variants were associated with an asymmetric increase in left ventricular maximum wall thickness (10.9 +/- 2.7 mm vs 9.4 +/- 1.6 mm; P < 0.001), but hypertrophy (>/=13 mm) was only present in 18.4% (n = 9 of 49; 95% CI: 9%-32%). SARC-HCM-P/LP variants were still associated with heart failure after adjustment for wall thickness (hazard ratio: 6.74; 95% CI: 2.43-18.7; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of middle-aged adults, SARC-HCM-P/LP variants have low aggregate penetrance for overt HCM but are associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and an attenuated cardiomyopathic phenotype. Although absolute event rates are low, identification of these variants may enhance risk stratification beyond familial disease."
34477909,Yes,Yes,No,No,Automatic machine learning based on native T1 mapping can identify myocardial fibrosis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of automatic machine learning (autoML) based on native T1 mapping to predict late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) status in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS: Ninety-one HCM patients and 44 healthy controls who underwent cardiovascular MRI were enrolled. The native T1 maps of HCM patients were classified as LGE ( +) or LGE (-) based on location-matched LGE images. An autoML pipeline was implemented using the tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT) for 3 binary classifications: LGE ( +) and LGE (-), LGE (-) and control, and HCM and control. TPOT modeling was repeated 10 times to obtain the optimal model for each classification. The diagnostic performance of the best models by slice and by case was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and microaveraged area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Ten prediction models were generated by TPOT for each of the 3 binary classifications. The diagnostic accuracy obtained with the best pipeline in detecting LGE status in the testing cohort of HCM patients was 0.80 by slice and 0.79 by case. In addition, the TPOT model also showed discriminability between LGE (-) patients and control (accuracy: 0.77 by slice; 0.78 by case) and for all HCM patients and controls (accuracy: 0.88 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Native T1 map analysis based on autoML correlates with LGE ( +) or (-) status. The TPOT machine learning algorithm could be a promising method for predicting myocardial fibrosis, as reflected by the presence of LGE in HCM patients without the need for late contrast-enhanced MRI sequences. KEY POINTS: * The tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT) is a machine learning algorithm that could help predict late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) status in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. * The TPOT could serve as an adjuvant method to detect LGE by using information from native T1 maps, thus avoiding the need for contrast agent. * The TPOT also detects native T1 map alterations in LGE-negative patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
34316386,Yes,Yes,No,No,Explanatory Analysis of a Machine Learning Model to Identify Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Patients from EHR Using Diagnostic Codes.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic heart disease that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young adults. Despite the well-known risk factors and existing clinical practice guidelines, HCM patients are underdiagnosed and sub-optimally managed. Developing machine learning models on electronic health record (EHR) data can help in better diagnosis of HCM and thus improve hundreds of patient lives. Automated phenotyping using HCM billing codes has received limited attention in the literature with a small number of prior publications. In this paper, we propose a novel predictive model that helps physicians in making diagnostic decisions, by means of information learned from historical data of similar patients. We assembled a cohort of 11,562 patients with known or suspected HCM who have visited Mayo Clinic between the years 1995 to 2019. All existing billing codes of these patients were extracted from the EHR data warehouse. Target ground truth labeling for training the machine learning model was provided by confirmed HCM diagnosis using the gold standard imaging tests for HCM diagnosis echocardiography (echo), or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. As the result, patients were labeled into three categories of ""yes definite HCM"", ""no HCM phenotype"", and ""possible HCM"" after a manual review of medical records and imaging tests. In this study, a random forest was adopted to investigate the predictive performance of billing codes for the identification of HCM patients due to its practical application and expected accuracy in a wide range of use cases. Our model performed well in finding patients with ""yes definite"", ""possible"" and ""no"" HCM with an accuracy of 71%, weighted recall of 70%, the precision of 75%, and weighted F1 score of 72%. Furthermore, we provided visualizations based on multidimensional scaling and the principal component analysis to provide insights for clinicians' interpretation. This model can be used for the identification of HCM patients using their EHR data, and help clinicians in their diagnosis decision making."
34280775,Yes,Yes,No,No,A machine learning-based risk stratification model for ventricular tachycardia and heart failure in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence are emerging as important components of precision medicine that enhance diagnosis and risk stratification. Risk stratification tools for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) exist, but they are based on traditional statistical methods. The aim was to develop a novel machine learning risk stratification tool for the prediction of 5-year risk in HCM. The goal was to determine if its predictive accuracy is higher than the accuracy of the state-of-the-art tools. METHOD: Data from a total of 2302 patients were used. The data were comprised of demographic characteristics, genetic data, clinical investigations, medications, and disease-related events. Four classification models were applied to model the risk level, and their decisions were explained using the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method. Unwanted cardiac events were defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia occurrence (VT), heart failure (HF), ICD activation, sudden cardiac death (SCD), cardiac death, and all-cause death. RESULTS: The proposed machine learning approach outperformed the similar existing risk-stratification models for SCD, cardiac death, and all-cause death risk-stratification: it achieved higher AUC by 17%, 9%, and 1%, respectively. The boosted trees achieved the best performing AUC of 0.82. The resulting model most accurately predicts VT, HF, and ICD with AUCs of 0.90, 0.88, and 0.87, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed risk-stratification model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting events in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The use of a machine-learning risk stratification model may improve patient management, clinical practice, and outcomes in general."
34229451,Yes,Yes,No,No,Toward Replacing Late Gadolinium Enhancement With Artificial Intelligence Virtual Native Enhancement for Gadolinium-Free Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Tissue Characterization in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the gold standard for noninvasive myocardial tissue characterization but requires intravenous contrast agent administration. It is highly desired to develop a contrast agent-free technology to replace LGE for faster and cheaper CMR scans. METHODS: A CMR virtual native enhancement (VNE) imaging technology was developed using artificial intelligence. The deep learning model for generating VNE uses multiple streams of convolutional neural networks to exploit and enhance the existing signals in native T1 maps (pixel-wise maps of tissue T1 relaxation times) and cine imaging of cardiac structure and function, presenting them as LGE-equivalent images. The VNE generator was trained using generative adversarial networks. This technology was first developed on CMR datasets from the multicenter Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Registry, using hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as an exemplar. The datasets were randomized into 2 independent groups for deep learning training and testing. The test data of VNE and LGE were scored and contoured by experienced human operators to assess image quality, visuospatial agreement, and myocardial lesion burden quantification. Image quality was compared using a nonparametric Wilcoxon test. Intra- and interobserver agreement was analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Lesion quantification by VNE and LGE were compared using linear regression and ICC. RESULTS: A total of 1348 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients provided 4093 triplets of matched T1 maps, cines, and LGE datasets. After randomization and data quality control, 2695 datasets were used for VNE method development and 345 were used for independent testing. VNE had significantly better image quality than LGE, as assessed by 4 operators (n=345 datasets; P<0.001 [Wilcoxon test]). VNE revealed lesions characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in high visuospatial agreement with LGE. In 121 patients (n=326 datasets), VNE correlated with LGE in detecting and quantifying both hyperintensity myocardial lesions (r=0.77-0.79; ICC=0.77-0.87; P<0.001) and intermediate-intensity lesions (r=0.70-0.76; ICC=0.82-0.85; P<0.001). The native CMR images (cine plus T1 map) required for VNE can be acquired within 15 minutes and producing a VNE image takes less than 1 second. CONCLUSIONS: VNE is a new CMR technology that resembles conventional LGE but without the need for contrast administration. VNE achieved high agreement with LGE in the distribution and quantification of lesions, with significantly better image quality."
34225646,Yes,Yes,No,No,Integration of transcriptomic data identifies key hallmark genes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) represents one of the most common inherited heart diseases. To identify key molecules involved in the development of HCM, gene expression patterns of the heart tissue samples in HCM patients from multiple microarray and RNA-seq platforms were investigated. METHODS: The significant genes were obtained through the intersection of two gene sets, corresponding to the identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within the microarray data and within the RNA-Seq data. Those genes were further ranked using minimum-Redundancy Maximum-Relevance feature selection algorithm. Moreover, the genes were assessed by three different machine learning methods for classification, including support vector machines, random forest and k-Nearest Neighbor. RESULTS: Outstanding results were achieved by taking exclusively the top eight genes of the ranking into consideration. Since the eight genes were identified as candidate HCM hallmark genes, the interactions between them and known HCM disease genes were explored through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Most candidate HCM hallmark genes were found to have direct or indirect interactions with known HCM diseases genes in the PPI network, particularly the hub genes JAK2 and GADD45A. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the transcriptomic data integration, in combination with machine learning methods, in providing insight into the key hallmark genes in the genetic etiology of HCM."
34169259,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine Learning Methods for Identifying Atrial Fibrillation Cases and Their Predictors in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: The HCM-AF-Risk Model.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients have a high incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and increased stroke risk, even with low CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age diabetes, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack) scores. Hence, there is a need to understand the pathophysiology of AF/stroke in HCM. In this retrospective study, we develop and apply a data-driven, machine learning-based method to identify AF cases, and clinical/imaging features associated with AF, using electronic health record data. METHODS: HCM patients with documented paroxysmal/persistent/permanent AF (n = 191) were considered AF cases, and the remaining patients in sinus rhythm (n = 640) were tagged as No-AF. We evaluated 93 clinical variables; the most informative variables useful for distinguishing AF from No-AF cases were selected based on the 2-sample t test and the information gain criterion. RESULTS: We identified 18 highly informative variables that are positively (n = 11) and negatively (n = 7) correlated with AF in HCM. Next, patient records were represented via these 18 variables. Data imbalance resulting from the relatively low number of AF cases was addressed via a combination of oversampling and undersampling strategies. We trained and tested multiple classifiers under this sampling approach, showing effective classification. Specifically, an ensemble of logistic regression and naive Bayes classifiers, trained based on the 18 variables and corrected for data imbalance, proved most effective for separating AF from No-AF cases (sensitivity = 0.74, specificity = 0.70, C-index = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: Our model (HCM-AF-Risk Model) is the first machine learning-based method for identification of AF cases in HCM. This model demonstrates good performance, addresses data imbalance, and suggests that AF is associated with a more severe cardiac HCM phenotype."
34055932,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine Learning for Predicting Heart Failure Progression in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"Background: Development of advanced heart failure (HF) symptoms is the most common adverse pathway in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. Currently, there is a limited ability to identify HCM patients at risk of HF. Objectives: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML)-based model to identify individual HCM patients who are at high risk of developing advanced HF symptoms. Methods: From a consecutive cohort of HCM patients evaluated at the Tufts HCM Institute from 2001 to 2018, we extracted a set of 64 potential risk factors measured at baseline. Only patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I/II and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiography >35% were included. The study cohort (n = 1,427 patients) was split into three disjoint subsets: development (50%), model selection (10%), and independent validation (40%). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to select the most influential clinical variables. An ensemble of ML classifiers, including logistic regression, was used to identify patients with high risk of developing a HF outcome. Study outcomes were defined as progression to NYHA class III/IV, drop in LVEF below 35%, septal reduction procedure, and/or heart transplantation. Results: During a mean follow-up of 4.7 +/- 3.7 years, advanced HF occurred in 283 (20% out of 1,427) patients. The model features included patients' sex, NYHA class (I or II), HCM type (i.e., obstructive or not), LV wall thickness, LVEF, presence of HF symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, presyncope), comorbidities (atrial fibrillation, hypertension, mitral regurgitation, and systolic anterior motion), and type of cardiac medications. The developed risk stratification model showed strong differentiation power to identify patients at advanced HF risk in the testing dataset (c-statistics = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76, 0.86). The model allowed correct identification of high-risk patients with accuracy 74% (CI: 0.70, 0.78), sensitivity 80% (CI: 0.77, 0.83), and specificity 72% (CI: 0.68, 0.76). The model performance was comparable among different sex and age groups. Conclusions: A 5-year risk prediction of progressive HF in HCM patients can be accurately estimated using ML analysis of patients' clinical and imaging parameters. A set of 17 clinical and imaging variables were identified as the most important predictors of progressive HF in HCM."
33961944,Yes,Yes,No,No,A radiomic approach to predict myocardial fibrosis on coronary CT angiography in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) derived from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) represents myocardial fibrosis (MF) and is associated with prognosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, it cannot be evaluated when CMR is unavailable. Hence, we aimed to investigate the ability of radiomic features derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to detect the presence and extent of MF in HCM, with LGE as references. METHODS: 161 patients with HCM who underwent CCTA and CMR were retrospectively enrolled and randomly divided into training (107 patients, 1712 segments) and testing cohorts (54 patients, 864 segments). Segments were obtained according to AHA 17-segment method. Radiomic features were extracted from per-segment and entire myocardium regions, and multiple machine-learning algorithms were used for radiomic signatures (Rad-sig) generation and model building. Four models were established by multivariable logistic regression using Rad-sig (R-model), clinical characteristic (C-model), echocardiography parameters (E-model), and all features integrated (Integ-model) to identify LGE/left ventricular mass >/= 15%. RESULTS: The model achieved good diagnostic accuracy in both training (area under the curve [AUC]:0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78-0.83) and testing cohort (AUC: 0.78, 95%CI: 0.75-0.81) on a per-segment basis for the presence of MF. The Integ-model owned the highest discriminative ability for patients with LGE/left ventricular mass >/= 15% in both training and testing cohorts with AUC of 0.94 (95%CI: 0.89-0.98) and 0.92 (95%CI: 0.85-0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our radiomic models were considered as useful and complementary biomarkers for the evaluation of the presence and extent of MF on CCTA, facilitating clinical decision-making and risk stratification in HCM patients."
33890823,Yes,Yes,No,No,Prediction of Genotype Positivity in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Using Machine Learning.,"BACKGROUND: Genetic testing can determine family screening strategies and has prognostic and diagnostic value in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, it can also pose a significant psychosocial burden. Conventional scoring systems offer modest ability to predict genotype positivity. The aim of our study was to develop a novel prediction model for genotype positivity in patients with HCM by applying machine learning (ML) algorithms. METHODS: We constructed 3 ML models using readily available clinical and cardiac imaging data of 102 patients from Columbia University with HCM who had undergone genetic testing (the training set). We validated model performance on 76 patients with HCM from Massachusetts General Hospital (the test set). Within the test set, we compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) for the ML models against the AUROCs generated by the Toronto HCM Genotype Score (the Toronto score) and Mayo HCM Genotype Predictor (the Mayo score) using the Delong test and net reclassification improvement. RESULTS: Overall, 63 of the 178 patients (35%) were genotype positive. The random forest ML model developed in the training set demonstrated an AUROC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85-0.99) in predicting genotype positivity in the test set, significantly outperforming the Toronto score (AUROC, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.65-0.90], P=0.004, net reclassification improvement: P<0.001) and the Mayo score (AUROC, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.67-0.92], P=0.01, net reclassification improvement: P=0.001). The gradient boosted decision tree ML model also achieved significant net reclassification improvement over the Toronto score (P<0.001) and the Mayo score (P=0.03), with an AUROC of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.75-0.99). Compared with the Toronto and Mayo scores, all 3 ML models had higher sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: Our ML models demonstrated a superior ability to predict genotype positivity in patients with HCM compared with conventional scoring systems in an external validation test set."

33841599,Yes,Yes,No,No,Giant deep vein thrombus complicating endovascular cooling therapy after cardiac arrest in a boy with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Mild hypothermia therapy (33-36  degrees C) is useful in preventing anoxic brain injury occurring after return of spontaneous circulation among survivors of cardiac arrest. Adverse events generally include bleeding, pneumonia, bradycardia, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, one rare complication is huge DVT. We recently encountered a boy with ventricular fibrillation due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy complicated by huge DVT from bilateral common femoral veins close to the hepatic vein during endovascular cooling therapy via his femoral vein. We successfully managed this case without any complications after infusion of unfractionated heparin to maintain a relatively high activated partial thromboplastin time. <Learning objective: We should be more careful in screening for deep vein thrombosis before and after endovascular cooling therapy.>."
33779725,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine learning phenotyping of scarred myocardium from cine in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"AIMS: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is increasingly being used in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) for diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring. However, recent data demonstrating brain gadolinium deposits have raised safety concerns. We developed and validated a machine-learning (ML) method that incorporates features extracted from cine to identify HCM patients without fibrosis in whom gadolinium can be avoided. METHODS AND RESULTS: An XGBoost ML model was developed using regional wall thickness and thickening, and radiomic features of myocardial signal intensity, texture, size, and shape from cine. A CMR dataset containing 1099 HCM patients collected using 1.5T CMR scanners from different vendors and centres was used for model development (n=882) and validation (n=217). Among the 2613 radiomic features, we identified 7 features that provided best discrimination between +LGE and -LGE using 10-fold stratified cross-validation in the development cohort. Subsequently, an XGBoost model was developed using these radiomic features, regional wall thickness and thickening. In the independent validation cohort, the ML model yielded an area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77-0.89), sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 62%, F1-score of 77%, true negatives rate (TNR) of 34%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 89%. Optimization for sensitivity provided sensitivity of 96%, F2-score of 83%, TNR of 19% and NPV of 91%; false negatives halved from 4% to 2%. CONCLUSION: An ML model incorporating novel radiomic markers of myocardium from cine can rule-out myocardial fibrosis in one-third of HCM patients referred for CMR reducing unnecessary gadolinium administration."
33735065,Yes,Yes,No,No,Diagnosis and risk stratification in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using machine learning wall thickness measurement: a comparison with human test-retest performance.,"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular maximum wall thickness (MWT) is central to diagnosis and risk stratification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but human measurement is prone to variability. We developed an automated machine learning algorithm for MWT measurement and compared precision (reproducibility) with that of 11 international experts, using a dataset of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. METHODS: 60 adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, including those carrying hypertrophic cardiomyopathy gene mutations, were recruited at three institutes in the UK from August, 2018, to September, 2019: Barts Heart Centre, University College London Hospital (The Heart Hospital), and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Participants had two cardiovascular magnetic resonance scans (test and retest) on the same day, ensuring no biological variability, using four cardiac MRI scanner models represented across two manufacturers and two field strengths. End-diastolic short-axis MWT was measured in test and retest by 11 international experts (from nine centres in six countries) and an automated machine learning method, which was trained to segment endocardial and epicardial contours on an independent, multicentre, multidisease dataset of 1923 patients. Machine learning MWT measurement was done with a method based on solving Laplace's equation. To assess test-retest reproducibility, we estimated the absolute test-retest MWT difference (precision), the coefficient of variation (CoV) for duplicate measurements, and the number of patients reclassified between test and retest according to different thresholds (MWT >15 mm and >30 mm). We calculated the sample size required to detect a prespecified MWT change between pairs of scans for machine learning and each expert. FINDINGS: 1440 MWT measurements were analysed, corresponding to two scans from 60 participants by 12 observers (11 experts and machine learning). Experts differed in the MWT they measured, ranging from 14.9 mm (SD 4.2) to 19.0 mm (4.7; p<0.0001 for trend). Machine learning-measured mean MWT was 16.8 mm (4.1). Machine learning precision was superior, with a test-retest difference of 0.7 mm (0.6) compared with experts, who ranged from 1.1 mm (0.9) to 3.7 mm (2.0; p values for machine learning vs expert comparison ranging from <0.0001 to 0.0073) and a significantly lower CoV than for all experts (4.3% [95% CI 3.3-5.1] vs 5.7-12.1% across experts). On average, 38 (64%) patients were designated as having MWT greater than 15 mm by machine learning compared with 27 (45%) to 50 (83%) patients by experts; five (8%) patients were reclassified in test-retest by machine learning compared with four (7%) to 12 (20%) by experts. With a cutoff point of more than 30 mm for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, three experts would have changed recommendations between tests a total of four times, but machine learning was consistent. Using machine learning, a clinical trial to detect a 2 mm MWT change would need 2.3 times (range 1.6-4.6) fewer patients. INTERPRETATION: In this preliminary study, machine learning MWT measurement in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is superior to human experts with potential implications for diagnosis, risk stratification, and clinical trials.

33304928,Yes,Yes,No,No,Neural-Network-Based Diagnosis Using 3-Dimensional Myocardial Architecture and Deformation: Demonstration for the Differentiation of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"The diagnosis of cardiomyopathy states may benefit from machine-learning (ML) based approaches, particularly to distinguish those states with similar phenotypic characteristics. Three-dimensional myocardial deformation analysis (3D-MDA) has been validated to provide standardized descriptors of myocardial architecture and deformation, and may therefore offer appropriate features for the training of ML-based diagnostic tools. We aimed to assess the feasibility of automated disease diagnosis using a neural network trained using 3D-MDA to discriminate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) from its mimic states: cardiac amyloidosis (CA), Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD), and hypertensive cardiomyopathy (HTNcm). 3D-MDA data from 163 patients (mean age 53.1 +/- 14.8 years; 68 females) with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of known etiology was provided. Source imaging data was from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Clinical diagnoses were as follows: 85 HCM, 30 HTNcm, 30 AFD, and 18 CA. A fully-connected-layer feed-forward neural was trained to distinguish HCM vs. other mimic states. Diagnostic performance was compared to threshold-based assessments of volumetric and strain-based CMR markers, in addition to baseline clinical patient characteristics. Threshold-based measures provided modest performance, the greatest area under the curve (AUC) being 0.70. Global strain parameters exhibited reduced performance, with AUC under 0.64. A neural network trained exclusively from 3D-MDA data achieved an AUC of 0.94 (sensitivity 0.92, specificity 0.90) when performing the same task. This study demonstrates that ML-based diagnosis of cardiomyopathy states performed exclusively from 3D-MDA is feasible and can distinguish HCM from mimic disease states. These findings suggest strong potential for computer-assisted diagnosis in clinical practice."
33272531,Yes,Yes,No,No,Texture analysis applied in T1 maps and extracellular volume obtained using cardiac MRI in the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertensive heart disease compared with normal controls.,"AIM: To assess the potential of texture analysis (TA) applied in T1 maps and extracellular volume (ECV) obtained using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and hypertensive heart disease (HHD) compared with normal controls (NC). Strain parameters were analysed to compare with final TA models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 66 HCM patients, 39 HHD patients, and 41 NC. Step-wise dimension reduction and feature selection were performed by reproducibility, machine learning, collinearity, and multivariable regression analysis to select the texture features that enable diagnosis of and differentiation between HCM and HHD. Strain parameters were calculated by short-axis and three long-axis cine sequences. RESULTS: Independent features in T1 maps and ECV analysis allowed for the differentiation between patients (HCM and HHD) and NC. Of the best-calculated model, the areas under the receiver operating curve (AUCs) were as follows: 0.969 for T1 map and 0.964 for ECV. To distinguish HCM from HHD, two independent features were screened out for both T1 and ECV maps. The AUCs were as follows: 0.793 for T1 map and 0.894 for ECV. Radial, circumferential, and longitudinal strain parameters could differentiate patients from NC, but only longitudinal strain parameters was significantly different between HCM and HHD. CONCLUSIONS: Texture analysis of T1 maps and ECV shows high accuracy in differentiating hypertrophic myocardium from NC, and HCM from HHD. Strain parameters are able to demonstrate the difference between patients and NC, but were less impressive in differentiating HCM and HHD."
33241513,Yes,Yes,No,No,Deep learning algorithm to improve hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation prediction using cardiac cine images.,"OBJECTIVES: The high variability of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) genetic phenotypes has prompted the establishment of risk-stratification systems that predict the risk of a positive genetic mutation based on clinical and echocardiographic profiles. This study aims to improve mutation-risk prediction by extracting cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) morphological features using a deep learning algorithm. METHODS: We recruited 198 HCM patients (48% men, aged 47 +/- 13 years) and divided them into training (147 cases) and test (51 cases) sets based on different genetic testing institutions and CMR scan dates (2012, 2013, respectively). All patients underwent CMR examinations, HCM genetic testing, and an assessment of established genotype scores (Mayo Clinic score I, Mayo Clinic score II, and Toronto score). A deep learning (DL) model was developed to classify the HCM genotypes, based on a nonenhanced four-chamber view of cine images. RESULTS: The areas under the curve (AUCs) for the test set were Mayo Clinic score I (AUC: 0.64, sensitivity: 64.29%, specificity: 47.83%), Mayo Clinic score II (AUC: 0.70, sensitivity: 64.29%, specificity: 65.22%), Toronto score (AUC: 0.74, sensitivity: 75.00%, specificity: 56.52%), and DL model (AUC: 0.80, sensitivity: 85.71%, specificity: 69.57%). The combination of the DL and the Toronto score resulted in a significantly higher predictive performance (AUC = 0.84, sensitivity: 83.33%, specificity: 78.26%), compared with Mayo I (p = 006), Mayo II (p = 022), and Toronto score (p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the DL model, based on nonenhanced cine CMR images and the Toronto score yielded significantly higher diagnostic performance in detecting HCM mutations. KEY POINTS: * Deep learning method could enable the extraction of image features from cine images. * Deep learning method based on cine images performed better than established scores in identifying HCM patients with positive genotypes. * The combination of the deep learning method based on cine images and the Toronto score could further improve the performance of the identification of HCM patients with positive genotypes."
33181159,Yes,Yes,No,No,Predicting the development of adverse cardiac events in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using machine learning.,"BACKGROUND: Only a subset of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) develop adverse cardiac events - e.g., end-stage heart failure, cardiovascular death. Current risk stratification methods are imperfect, limiting identification of high-risk patients with HCM. Our aim was to improve the prediction of adverse cardiac events in patients with HCM using machine learning methods. METHODS: We applied modern machine learning methods to a prospective cohort of adults with HCM. The outcome was a composite of death due to heart failure, heart transplant, and sudden death. As the reference model, we constructed logistic regression model using known predictors. We determined 20 predictive characteristics based on random forest classification and a priori knowledge, and developed 4 machine learning models. Results Of 183 patients in the cohort, the mean age was 53 (SD = 17) years and 45% were female. During the median follow-up of 2.2 years (interquartile range, 0.6-3.8), 33 subjects (18%) developed an outcome event, the majority of which (85%) was heart transplant. The predictive accuracy of the reference model was 73% (sensitivity 76%, specificity 72%) while that of the machine learning model was 85% (e.g., sensitivity 88%, specificity 84% with elastic net regression). All 4 machine learning models significantly outperformed the reference model - e.g., area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve 0.79 with the reference model vs. 0.93 with elastic net regression (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional risk stratification, the machine learning models demonstrated a superior ability to predict adverse cardiac events. These modern machine learning methods may enhance identification of high-risk HCM subpopulations."
33174017,Yes,Yes,No,No,Identification of circulating hub long noncoding RNAs associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using weighted correlation network analysis.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most commonly inherited heart diseases and the leading cause of sudden cardiac death among adolescents and young adults. Circulating long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have demonstrated potential as diagnostic and therapeutic targets in several cardiovascular diseases. However, the circulating extracellular lncRNA expression profile of patients with HCM remains unclear. Plasma lncRNA expression was evaluated in patients with HCM and healthy controls using a human lncRNA microarray. A weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and linear models for microarray data (Limma) were used. GSE68316 data from cardiac tissue in the Gene Expression Omnibus database were analysed for further validation. Using WGCNA, two modules (referred to as the magenta and the light‑yellow module) were identified that were positively associated with HCM. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that lncRNAs in the magenta module targeted 'heart growth'. Using Limma, a total of 290 lncRNAs were differentially expressed (210 upregulated and 80 downregulated) in the plasma of HCM patients, compared with controls. Moreover, combined WGCNA and Limma analysis demonstrated that 27 hub lncRNAs in the magenta module and 13 hub lncRNAs in the light‑yellow module were significantly upregulated, compared with the controls. Moreover, of the 40 differentially expressed hub lncRNAs identified in the two modules, three circulating lncRNAs (lnc‑P2RY6‑1:1, ENST00000488040 and ENST00000588047) were also significantly upregulated in the HCM cardiac tissue validation dataset. These lncRNAs may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precise diagnosis and treatment of HCM."
33099311,Yes,Yes,No,No,Weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed key biomarkers associated with the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"OBJECTIVE: To reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HCM and find new effective therapeutic strategies using a systematic biological approach. METHODS: The WGCNA algorithm was applied to building the co-expression network of HCM samples. A sample cluster analysis was performed using the hclust tool and a co-expression module was constructed. The WGCNA algorithm was used to study the interactive connection between co-expression modules and draw a heat map to show the strength of interactions between modules. The genetic information of the respective modules was mapped to the associated GO terms and KEGG pathways, and the Hub Genes with the highest connectivity in each module were identified. The Wilcoxon test was used to verify the expression level of hub genes between HCM and normal samples, and the ""pROC"" R package was used to verify the possibility of hub genes as biomarkers. Finally, the potential functions of hub genes were analyzed by GSEA software. RESULTS: Seven co-expression modules were constructed using sample clustering analysis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis judged that the turquoise module is an important module. The hub genes of each module are RPL35A for module Black, FH for module Blue, PREI3 for module Brown, CREB1 for module Green, LOC641848 for module Pink, MYH7 for module Turquoise and MYL6 for module Yellow. The results of the differential expression analysis indicate that MYH7 and FH are considered true hub genes. In addition, the ROC curves revealed their high diagnostic value as biomarkers for HCM. Finally, in the results of the GSEA analysis, MYH7 and FH highly expressed genes were enriched with the ""proteasome"" and a ""PPAR signaling pathway,"" respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The MYH7 and FH genes may be the true hub genes of HCM. Their respective enriched pathways, namely the ""proteasome"" and the ""PPAR signaling pathway,"" may play an important role in the development of HCM."
32525266,Yes,Yes,No,No,Radiomic Analysis of Native T(1) Mapping Images Discriminates Between MYH7 and MYBPC3-Related Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: The phenotype via conventional cardiac MRI analysis of MYH7 (beta-myosin heavy chain)- and MYBPC3 (beta-myosin-binding protein C)-associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) groups is similar. Few studies exist on the genotypic-phenotypic association as assessed by machine learning in HCM patients. PURPOSE: To explore the phenotypic differences based on radiomics analysis of T(1) mapping images between MYH7 and MYBPC3-associated HCM subgroups. STUDY TYPE: Prospective observational study. SUBJECTS: In all, 102 HCM patients with pathogenic, or likely pathogenic mutation, in MYH7 (n = 68) or MYBPC3 (n = 34) genes. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Cardiac MRI was performed at 3.0T with balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP), phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) T(1) mapping sequences. ASSESSMENT: All patients underwent next-generation sequencing and Sanger genetic sequencing. Left ventricular native T(1) and LGE were analyzed. One hundred and fifty-seven radiomic features were extracted and modeled using a support vector machine (SVM) combined with principal component analysis (PCA). Each subgroup was randomly split 4:1 (feature selection / test validation). STATISTICAL TESTS: Mann-Whitney U-tests and Student's t-tests were performed to assess differences between subgroups. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the model's ability to stratify patients based on radiomic features. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between MYH7- and MYBPC3-associated HCM subgroups based on traditional native T(1) values (global, basal, and middle short-axis slice native T(1) ; P = 0.760, 0.914, and 0.178, respectively). However, the SVM model combined with PCA achieved an accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) of 92.0% and 0.968 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.968-0.971), respectively. For the test validation dataset, the accuracy and AUC were 85.5% and 0.886 (95% CI: 0.881-0.901), respectively. DATA CONCLUSION: Radiomic analysis of native T(1) mapping images may be able to discriminate between MYH7- and MYBPC3-associated HCM patients, exceeding the performance of conventional native T(1) values.

32418493,Yes,Yes,No,No,A Validated Model for Sudden Cardiac Death Risk Prediction in Pediatric Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in children and young adults. Our objective was to develop and validate a SCD risk prediction model in pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to guide SCD prevention strategies. METHODS: In an international multicenter observational cohort study, phenotype-positive patients with isolated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <18 years of age at diagnosis were eligible. The primary outcome variable was the time from diagnosis to a composite of SCD events at 5-year follow-up: SCD, resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest, and aborted SCD, that is, appropriate shock following primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Competing risk models with cause-specific hazard regression were used to identify and quantify clinical and genetic factors associated with SCD. The cause-specific regression model was implemented using boosting, and tuned with 10 repeated 4-fold cross-validations. The final model was fitted using all data with the tuned hyperparameter value that maximizes the c-statistic, and its performance was characterized by using the c-statistic for competing risk models. The final model was validated in an independent external cohort (SHaRe [Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry], n=285). RESULTS: Overall, 572 patients met eligibility criteria with 2855 patient-years of follow-up. The 5-year cumulative proportion of SCD events was 9.1% (14 SCD, 25 resuscitated sudden cardiac arrests, and 14 aborted SCD). Risk predictors included age at diagnosis, documented nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, unexplained syncope, septal diameter z-score, left ventricular posterior wall diameter z score, left atrial diameter z score, peak left ventricular outflow tract gradient, and presence of a pathogenic variant. Unlike in adults, left ventricular outflow tract gradient had an inverse association, and family history of SCD had no association with SCD. Clinical and clinical/genetic models were developed to predict 5-year freedom from SCD. Both models adequately discriminated between patients with and without SCD events with a c-statistic of 0.75 and 0.76, respectively, and demonstrated good agreement between predicted and observed events in the primary and validation cohorts (validation c-statistic 0.71 and 0.72, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study provides a validated SCD risk prediction model with >70% prediction accuracy and incorporates risk factors that are unique to pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An individualized risk prediction model has the potential to improve the application of clinical practice guidelines and shared decision making for implantable cardioverter defibrillator insertion.

32344918,Yes,Yes,No,No,Genetic Dissection of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy with Myocardial RNA-Seq.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited disorder of the myocardium, and pathogenic mutations in the sarcomere genes myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) and myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) explain 60%-70% of observed clinical cases. The heterogeneity of phenotypes observed in HCM patients, however, suggests that novel causative genes or genetic modifiers likely exist. Here, we systemically evaluated RNA-seq data from 28 HCM patients and nine healthy controls with pathogenic variant identification, differential expression analysis, and gene co-expression and protein-protein interaction network analyses. We identified 43 potential pathogenic variants in 19 genes in 24 HCM patients. Genes with more than one variant included the following: MYBPC3, TTN, MYH7, PSEN2, and LDB3. A total of 2538 protein-coding genes, six microRNAs (miRNAs), and 1617 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified differentially expressed between the groups, including several well-characterized cardiomyopathy-related genes (ANKRD1, FHL2, TGFB3, miR-30d, and miR-154). Gene enrichment analysis revealed that those genes are significantly involved in heart development and physiology. Furthermore, we highlighted four subnetworks: mtDNA-subnetwork, DSP-subnetwork, MYH7-subnetwork, and MYBPC3-subnetwork, which could play significant roles in the progression of HCM. Our findings further illustrate that HCM is a complex disease, which results from mutations in multiple protein-coding genes, modulation by non-coding RNAs and perturbations in gene networks."
32079026,Yes,Yes,No,No,Separation of HCM and LQT Cardiac Diseases with Machine Learning of Ca2+ Transient Profiles.,"BACKGROUND:  Modeling human cardiac diseases with induced pluripotent stem cells not only enables to study disease pathophysiology and develop therapies but also, as we have previously showed, it can offer a tool for disease diagnostics. We previously observed that a few genetic cardiac diseases can be separated from each other and healthy controls by applying machine learning to Ca(2+) transient signals measured from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs). OBJECTIVES:  For the current research, 419 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) transient signals and 228 long QT syndrome (LQTS) transient signals were measured. HCM signals included data recorded from iPSC-CMs carrying either alpha-tropomyosin, i.e., TPM1 (HCMT) or MYBPC3 or myosin-binding protein C (HCMM) mutation and LQTS signals included data recorded from iPSC-CMs carrying potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 (KCNQ1) mutation (long QT syndrome 1 [LQT1]) or KCNH2 mutation (long QT syndrome 2 [LQT2]). The main objective was to study whether and how effectively HCMM and HCMT can be separated from each other as well as LQT1 from LQT2. METHODS:  After preprocessing those Ca(2+) signals where we computed peak waveforms we then classified the two mutations of both disease pairs by using several different machine learning methods. RESULTS:  We obtained excellent classification accuracies of 89% for HCM and even 100% for LQT at their best. CONCLUSION:  The results indicate that the methods applied would be efficient for the identification of these genetic cardiac diseases."
31727603,Yes,Yes,No,No,Assessment of ventricular tachyarrhythmia in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with machine learning-based texture analysis of late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MRI.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic value of machine learning-based texture feature analysis of late gadolinium enhancement images on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing the presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 64 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent cardiac MRI and 24-hour Holter monitoring within 1 year before cardiac MRI. There were 42 men and 22 women with a mean age of 48.13+/-13.06 (SD) years (range: 20-70 years). Quantitative textural features were extracted via manually placed regions of interest in areas with high and intermediate signal intensity on late gadolinium-chelate enhanced images. Feature selection and dimension reduction were performed. The diagnostic performances of machine learning classifiers including support vector machines, Naive Bayes, k-nearest-neighbors, and random forest for predicting the presence of VT were assessed using the results of 24-hour Holter monitoring as the reference test. All machine learning models were assessed with and without the application of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). RESULTS: Of the 64 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 21/64 (32.8%) had VT. Of eight machine learning models investigated, k-nearest-neighbors with SMOTE exhibited the best diagnostic accuracy for the presence or absence of VT. k-nearest-neighbors with SMOTE correctly identified 40/42 (95.2%) VT-positive patients and 40/43 (93.0%) VT-negative patients, yielding 95.2% sensitivity (95% CI: 82.5%-99.1%), 93.0% specificity (95% CI: 79.8%-98.1%) and 94.1% accuracy (95% CI: 88.8%-98%). CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based texture analysis of late gadolinium-chelate enhancement-positive areas is a promising tool for the classification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with and without VT."
31714190,Yes,Yes,No,No,Three-dimensional Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Automated Myocardial Scar Quantification in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: A Multicenter Multivendor Study.,"Background Cardiac MRI late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) scar volume is an important marker for outcome prediction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM); however, its clinical application is hindered by a lack of measurement standardization. Purpose To develop and evaluate a three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for automated LGE scar quantification in patients with HCM. Materials and Methods We retrospectively identified LGE MRI data in a multicenter (n = 7) and multivendor (n = 3) HCM study obtained between November 2001 and November 2011. A deep 3D CNN based on U-Net architecture was used for LGE scar quantification. Independent CNN training and testing data sets were maintained with a 4:1 ratio. Stacks of short-axis MRI slices were split into overlapping substacks that were segmented and then merged into one volume. The 3D CNN per-site and per-vendor performances were evaluated with respect to manual scar quantification performed in a core laboratory setting using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Pearson correlation, and Bland-Altman analyses. Furthermore, the performance of 3D CNN was compared with that of two-dimensional (2D) CNN. Results This study included 1073 patients with HCM (733 men; mean age, 49 years +/- 17 [standard deviation]). The 3D CNN-based quantification was fast (0.15 second per image) and demonstrated excellent correlation with manual scar volume quantification (r = 0.88, P < .001) and ratio of scar volume to total left ventricle myocardial volume (%LGE) (r = 0.91, P < .001). The 3D CNN-based quantification strongly correlated with manual quantification of scar volume (r = 0.82-0.99, P < .001) and %LGE (r = 0.90-0.97, P < .001) for all sites and vendors. The 3D CNN identified patients with a large scar burden (>15%) with 98% accuracy (202 of 207) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 95%, 99%). When compared with 3D CNN, 2D CNN underestimated scar volume (r = 0.85, P < .001) and %LGE (r = 0.83, P < .001). The DSC of 3D CNN segmentation was comparable among different vendors (P = .07) and higher than that of 2D CNN (DSC, 0.54 +/- 0.26 vs 0.48 +/- 0.29; P = .02). Conclusion In the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy population, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network enables fast and accurate quantification of myocardial scar volume, outperforms a two-dimensional convolutional neural network, and demonstrates comparable performance across different vendors.

31304403,Yes,Yes,No,No,Machine learning detection of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using a wearable biosensor.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heritable disease of heart muscle that increases the risk for heart failure, stroke, and sudden death, even in asymptomatic patients. With only 10-20% of affected people currently diagnosed, there is an unmet need for an effective screening tool outside of the clinical setting. Photoplethysmography uses a noninvasive optical sensor incorporated in commercial smart watches to detect blood volume changes at the skin surface. In this study, we obtained photoplethysmography recordings and echocardiograms from 19 HCM patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (oHCM) and a control cohort of 64 healthy volunteers. Automated analysis showed a significant difference in oHCM patients for 38/42 morphometric pulse wave features, including measures of systolic ejection time, rate of rise during systole, and respiratory variation. We developed a machine learning classifier that achieved a C-statistic for oHCM detection of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99-1.0). With further development, this approach could provide a noninvasive and widely available screening tool for obstructive HCM."
31243064,Yes,Yes,No,No,Identification of a Multiplex Biomarker Panel for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Using Quantitative Proteomics and Machine Learning.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined by pathological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It is the commonest inherited cardiac condition and a significant number of high risk cases still go undetected until a sudden cardiac death (SCD) event. Plasma biomarkers do not currently feature in the assessment of HCM disease progression, which is tracked by serial imaging, or in SCD risk stratification, which is based on imaging parameters and patient/family history. There is a need for new HCM plasma biomarkers to refine disease monitoring and improve patient risk stratification. To identify new plasma biomarkers for patients with HCM, we performed exploratory myocardial and plasma proteomics screens and subsequently developed a multiplexed targeted liquid chromatography-tandem/mass spectrometry-based assay to validate the 26 peptide biomarkers that were identified. The association of discovered biomarkers with clinical phenotypes was prospectively tested in plasma from 110 HCM patients with LVH (LVH+ HCM), 97 controls, and 16 HCM sarcomere gene mutation carriers before the development of LVH (subclinical HCM). Six peptides (aldolase fructose-bisphosphate A, complement C3, glutathione S-transferase omega 1, Ras suppressor protein 1, talin 1, and thrombospondin 1) were increased significantly in the plasma of LVH+ HCM compared with controls and correlated with imaging markers of phenotype severity: LV wall thickness, mass, and percentage myocardial scar on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Using supervised machine learning (ML), this six-biomarker panel differentiated between LVH+ HCM and controls, with an area under the curve of >/= 0.87. Five of these peptides were also significantly increased in subclinical HCM compared with controls. In LVH+ HCM, the six-marker panel correlated with the presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and the estimated five-year risk of sudden cardiac death. Using quantitative proteomic approaches, we have discovered six potentially useful circulating plasma biomarkers related to myocardial substrate changes in HCM, which correlate with the estimated sudden cardiac death risk."
31160009,Yes,Yes,No,No,Automated extraction of sudden cardiac death risk factors in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients by natural language processing.,"BACKGROUND: The management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients requires the knowledge of risk factors associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD). SCD risk factors such as syncope and family history of SCD (FH-SCD) as well as family history of HCM (FH-HCM) are documented in electronic health records (EHRs) as clinical narratives. Automated extraction of risk factors from clinical narratives by natural language processing (NLP) may expedite management workflow of HCM patients. The aim of this study was to develop and deploy NLP algorithms for automated extraction of syncope, FH-SCD, and FH-HCM from clinical narratives. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly selected 200 patients from the Mayo HCM registry for development (n = 100) and testing (n = 100) of NLP algorithms for extraction of syncope, FH-SCD as well as FH-HCM from clinical narratives of EHRs. The clinical reference standard was manually abstracted by 2 independent annotators. Performance of NLP algorithms was compared to aggregation and summarization of data entries in the HCM registry for syncope, FH-SCD, and FH-HCM. We also compared the NLP algorithms with billing codes for syncope as well as responses to patient survey questions for FH-SCD and FH-HCM. These analyses demonstrated NLP had superior sensitivity (0.96 vs 0.39, p < 0.001) and comparable specificity (0.90 vs 0.92, p = 0.74) and PPV (0.90 vs 0.83, p = 0.37) compared to billing codes for syncope. For FH-SCD, NLP outperformed survey responses for all parameters (sensitivity: 0.91 vs 0.59, p = 0.002; specificity: 0.98 vs 0.50, p < 0.001; PPV: 0.97 vs 0.38, p < 0.001). NLP also achieved superior sensitivity (0.95 vs 0.24, p < 0.001) with comparable specificity (0.95 vs 1.0, p-value not calculable) and positive predictive value (PPV) (0.92 vs 1.0, p = 0.09) compared to survey responses for FH-HCM. CONCLUSIONS: Automated extraction of syncope, FH-SCD and FH-HCM using NLP is feasible and has promise to increase efficiency of workflow for providers managing HCM patients."
30952382,Yes,Yes,No,No,Identifying Ventricular Arrhythmias and Their Predictors by Applying Machine Learning Methods to Electronic Health Records in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM-VAr-Risk Model).,"Clinical risk stratification for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) employs rules derived from American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) guidelines or the HCM Risk-SCD model (C-index  approximately 0.69), which utilize a few clinical variables. We assessed whether data-driven machine learning methods that consider a wider range of variables can effectively identify HC patients with ventricular arrhythmias (VAr) that lead to SCD. We scanned the electronic health records of 711 HC patients for sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Patients with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (n = 61) were tagged as VAr cases and the remaining (n = 650) as non-VAr. The 2-sample ttest and information gain criterion were used to identify the most informative clinical variables that distinguish VAr from non-VAr; patient records were reduced to include only these variables. Data imbalance stemming from low number of VAr cases was addressed by applying a combination of over- and undersampling strategies. We trained and tested multiple classifiers under this sampling approach, showing effective classification. We evaluated 93 clinical variables, of which 22 proved predictive of VAr. The ensemble of logistic regression and naive Bayes classifiers, trained based on these 22 variables and corrected for data imbalance, was most effective in separating VAr from non-VAr cases (sensitivity = 0.73, specificity = 0.76, C-index = 0.83). Our method (HCM-VAr-Risk Model) identified 12 new predictors of VAr, in addition to 10 established SCD predictors. In conclusion, this is the first application of machine learning for identifying HC patients with VAr, using clinical attributes. Our model demonstrates good performance (C-index) compared with currently employed SCD prediction algorithms, while addressing imbalance inherent in clinical data."
29685546,Yes,Yes,No,No,Texture analysis and machine learning of non-contrast T1-weighted MR images in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-Preliminary results.,"PURPOSE: To test in a first proof-of-concept study whether texture analysis (TA) allows for the detection of myocardial tissue alterations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) on non-contrast T1-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images using machine learning based approaches. METHODS: This retrospective, IRB-approved study included 32 patients with known HCM. Thirty patients with normal CMR served as controls. Regions-of-interest for TA encompassing the left ventricle were drawn on short-axis non-contrast T1-weighted images using a freely available software package. Step-wise dimension reduction and texture feature selection was performed for selecting features enabling the detection of myocardial tissue alterations in HCM patients on non-contrast T1-weighted CMR images. RESULTS: Comparing HCM patients and controls, four texture features were identified showing significant differences between groups (Grey-level Non-uniformity [GLevNonU]: 74 +/- 17 vs. 38 +/- 9, p < .001; Energy of wavelet coefficients in low-frequency sub-bands [WavEnLL]: 58 +/- 5 vs. 48 +/- 10, p < .001; Fraction: 0.70 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.78 +/- 0.05, p < .001; Sum Average: 16.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 17.0 +/- 0.5, p = .007). A model containing the single parameter GLevNonU proved to be the best for differentiating between HCM patients and controls with a sensitivity/specificity of 91%/93%. A cut-off of GLevNonU >/=46 allowed for distinguishing HCM patients from controls with a sensitivity/specificity of 94%/90%. Even in patients without late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), the defined cut-off led to a differentiation of LGE- patients from healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: TA on non-contrast T1-weighted images allows for the detection of myocardial tissue alterations in the setting of HCM with excellent accuracy, delivering potential novel parameters for a non-contrast assessment of myocardial texture alterations."
27840985,Yes,Yes,No,No,RNA‑seq profiling of mRNA associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"The mechanisms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) pathogenesis can be investigated by determining the differences between healthy and disease states at the molecular level. In the present study, large‑scale transcriptome sequencing was performed to compare mRNA expression in patients with HCM and control groups using an Illumina sequencing platform. Compared with the genome background, 257 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in which 62 genes were downregulated and 195 genes were upregulated. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to validate the expression pattern of certain mRNAs. Gene ontology enrichment and KEGG analysis of mRNAs was conducted to identify the biological modules and pathological pathways associated with the DEGs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time study to investigate the differences in mRNA between patients with HCM and normal controls at the transcriptome level. The results of the study will contributed to the understanding of the important molecular mechanisms involved in HCM and aid the selection of key genes to investigate in the future."
27713503,Yes,Yes,No,No,Left Atrial trajectory impairment in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy disclosed by Geometric Morphometrics and Parallel Transport.,"The analysis of full Left Atrium (LA) deformation and whole LA deformational trajectory in time has been poorly investigated and, to the best of our knowledge, seldom discussed in patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. Therefore, we considered 22 patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 46 healthy subjects, investigated them by three-dimensional Speckle Tracking Echocardiography, and studied the derived landmark clouds via Geometric Morphometrics with Parallel Transport. Trajectory shape and trajectory size were different in Controls versus HCM and their classification powers had high AUC (Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristic Curve) and accuracy. The two trajectories were much different at the transition between LA conduit and booster pump functions. Full shape and deformation analyses with trajectory analysis enabled a straightforward perception of pathophysiological consequences of HCM condition on LA functioning. It might be worthwhile to apply these techniques to look for novel pathophysiological approaches that may better define atrio-ventricular interaction."
26141701,Yes,Yes,No,No,Microarray profiling of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited disorder with around 1400 known mutations; however the molecular pathways leading from genotype to phenotype are not fully understood. LncRNAs, which account for approximately 98 % of human genome, are becoming increasingly interesting with regard to various diseases. However, changes in the expression of regulatory lncRNAs in HCM have not yet been reported. To identify myocardial lncRNAs involved in HCM and characterize their roles in HCM pathogenesis. METHODS: Myocardial tissues were obtained from 7 HCM patients and 5 healthy individuals, and lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles were analyzed using the Arraystar human lncRNA microarray. Real-time PCR was conducted to validate the expression pattern of lncRNA and mRNA. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and KEGG analysis of mRNAs was conducted to identify the related biological modules and pathologic pathways. RESULTS: Approximately 1426 lncRNAs (965 up-regulated and 461 down-regulated) and 1715 mRNAs (896 up-regulated and 819 down-regulated) were aberrantly expressed in HCM patients with fold change > 2.0. GO analysis indicated that these lncRNAs-coexpressed mRNAs were targeted to translational process. Pathway analysis indicated that lncRNAs-coexpressed mRNAs were mostly enriched in ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: LncRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of HCM through the modulation of multiple pathogenetic pathways."
21817903,Yes,Yes,No,No,High-throughput genotyping robot-assisted method for mutation detection in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most frequent autosomal dominant genetic heart muscle disease and the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people (under 30 y of age), who are often unaware of their underlying condition. Genetic screening is now considered a fundamental tool for clinical management of HCM families. However, the high genetic heterogeneity of HCM makes genetic screening very expensive. Here, we propose a new high-throughput genotyping method based on a HCM 96-well sequencing plate for the analysis of 8 of the most frequent HCM-causing sarcomeric genes by automating several processes required for direct sequencing, using a commercially available robotic systems and routinely used instruments. To assess the efficiency of the robot-assisted method, we have analyzed the entire coding sequence and flanking intronic sequences of the 8 sarcomeric genes in samples from 18 patients affected by HCM and their relatives, which revealed 9 different mutations, 3 of which were novel. The automated, robot-assisted assembling of polymerase chain reaction, purification of polymerase chain reaction products, and assembly of sequencing reactions resulted in a substantial saving of time, reagent costs, and reduction of human errors, and can therefore be proposed as a primary strategy for mutation identification in HCM genetic screening in many medical genetic laboratories."
6939263,Yes,Yes,No,No,Neuromuscular changes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Clinical, electrophysiological and histological studies of skeletal muscle were performed in 12 patients with primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy trying to add more information about the skeletal muscle affectation in this disease. Eight cases showed mild increase in serum enzymes. All of the patients showed slight abnormalities in the electrophysiologic studies: four had abnormal conduction velocities in peripheral nerve, another four a myopathic pattern in the EMG and four a mixed pattern. Histologically only 2 patients showed signs of a denervation atrophy. The most common alterations found were non-specific (isolated fibre atrophy, disorganization of the myofibrillar network and type II atrophy)."
37831014,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Improved Diagnostic Criteria for Apical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND: There is no acceptable maximum wall thickness (MWT) threshold for diagnosing apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ApHCM), with guidelines referring to >/=15 mm MWT for all hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtypes. A normal myocardium naturally tapers apically; a fixed diagnostic threshold fails to account for this. Using cardiac magnetic resonance, ""relative"" ApHCM has been described with typical electrocardiographic features, loss of apical tapering, and cavity obliteration but also with MWT <15 mm. OBJECTIVES: The authors aimed to define normal apical wall thickness thresholds in healthy subjects and use these to accurately identify ApHCM. METHODS: The following healthy subjects were recruited: healthy UK Biobank imaging substudy subjects (n = 4,112) and an independent healthy volunteer group (n = 489). A clinically defined disease population of 104 ApHCM subjects was enrolled, with 72 overt (MWT >/=15 mm) and 32 relative (MWT <15 mm but typical electrocardiographic/imaging findings) ApHCM subjects. Cardiac magnetic resonance-derived MWT was measured in 16 segments using a published clinically validated machine learning algorithm. Segmental normal reference ranges were created and indexed (for age, sex, and body surface area), and diagnostic performance was assessed. RESULTS: In healthy cohorts, there was no clinically significant age-related difference for apical wall thickness. There were sex-related differences, but these were not clinically significant after indexing to body surface area. Therefore, segmental reference ranges for apical hypertrophy required indexing to body surface area only (not age or sex). The upper limit of normal (the largest of the 4 apical segments measured) corresponded to a maximum apical MWT in healthy subjects of 5.2 to 5.6 mm/m(2) with an accuracy of 0.94 (the unindexed equivalent being 11 mm). This threshold was categorized as abnormal in 99% (71/72) of overt ApHCM patients, 78% (25/32) of relative ApHCM patients, 3% (122/4,112) of UK Biobank subjects, and 3% (13/489) of healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Per-segment indexed apical wall thickness thresholds are highly accurate for detecting apical hypertrophy, providing confidence to the reader to diagnose ApHCM in those not reaching current internationally recognized criteria."
36589312,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Tandem deep learning and logistic regression models to optimize hypertrophic cardiomyopathy detection in routine clinical practice.,"BACKGROUND: An electrocardiogram (ECG)-based artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm has shown good performance in detecting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, its application in routine clinical practice may be challenging owing to the low disease prevalence and potentially high false-positive rates. OBJECTIVE: Identify clinical characteristics associated with true- and false-positive HCM AI-ECG results to improve its clinical application. METHODS: We reviewed the records of the 200 patients with highest HCM AI-ECG scores in January 2021 at our institution. Logistic regression was used to create a clinical variable-based ""Candidacy for HCM Detection (HCM-DETECT)"" score, differentiating true-positive from false-positive AI-ECG results. We validated the HCM-DETECT score in an independent cohort of 200 patients with the highest AI-ECG scores from January 2022. RESULTS: In the 2021 cohort (median age 71 [interquartile range 58-80] years, 48% female), the rates of true-positive, false-positive, and indeterminate AI-ECG results for HCM detection were 36%, 48%, and 16%, respectively. In the 2022 cohort, the rates were 26%, 47%, and 27%, respectively. The HCM-DETECT score included age, coronary artery disease, prior pacemaker, and prior cardiac valve surgery, and had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.73-0.87) for differentiating true- vs false-positive AI results. When the 2022 cohort was limited to HCM detection candidates identified with the HCM-DETECT score, the false-positive AI-ECG rate was reduced from 47% to 13.5%. CONCLUSION: Application of a clinical score (HCM-DETECT) in tandem with an AI-ECG model improved HCM detection yield, reducing the false-positive rate of AI-ECG more than 3-fold."
36061538,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: From bench to bedside.,"Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mostly experience minimal symptoms throughout their lifetime, and some individuals have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). How to identify patients with a higher risk of ventricular arrythmias and SCD is the priority in HCM research. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) both recommend the use of risk algorithms to identify patients at high risk of ventricular arrhythmias, to be selected for implantation of implantable cardioverters/defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention of SCD, although major discrepancies exist. The present SCD risk scoring systems cannot accurately identify early-stage HCM patients with modest structural remodeling and mild disease manifestations. Unfortunately, SCD events could occur in young asymptomatic HCM patients and even as initial symptoms, prompting the determination of new risk factors for SCD. This review summarizes the studies based on patients' surgical specimens, transgenic animals, and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to explore the possible molecular mechanism of ventricular arrhythmia and SCD. Ion channel remodeling, Ca2+ homeostasis abnormalities, and increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity may contribute to changes in action potential duration (APD), reentry circuit formation, and trigger activities, such as early aferdepolarization (EAD) or delayed afterdepolarization (DAD), leading to ventricular arrhythmia in HCM. Besides the ICD implantation, novel drugs represented by the late sodium current channel inhibitor and myosin inhibitor also shed light on the prevention of HCM-related arrhythmias. The ideal prevention strategy of SCD in early-stage HCM patients needs to be combined with gene screening, hiPSC-CM testing, machine learning, and advanced ECG studies, thus achieving individualized SCD prevention."
35523549,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,[Automatic detection model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy based on deep convolutional neural network].,"The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is of great significance for the early risk classification of sudden cardiac death and the screening of family genetic diseases. This research proposed a HCM automatic detection method based on convolution neural network (CNN) model, using single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal as the research object. Firstly, the R-wave peak locations of single-lead ECG signal were determined, followed by the ECG signal segmentation and resample in units of heart beats, then a CNN model was built to automatically extract the deep features in the ECG signal and perform automatic classification and HCM detection. The experimental data is derived from 108 ECG records extracted from three public databases provided by PhysioNet, the database established in this research consists of 14,459 heartbeats, and each heartbeat contains 128 sampling points. The results revealed that the optimized CNN model could effectively detect HCM, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 95.98%, 98.03% and 95.79% respectively. In this research, the deep learning method was introduced for the analysis of single-lead ECG of HCM patients, which could not only overcome the technical limitations of conventional detection methods based on multi-lead ECG, but also has important application value for assisting doctor in fast and convenient large-scale HCM preliminary screening."
34778415,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,"Radiomics-Based Classification of Left Ventricular Non-compaction, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, and Dilated Cardiomyopathy in Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance.","Left Ventricular (LV) Non-compaction (LVNC), Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM), and Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) share morphological and functional traits that increase the diagnosis complexity. Additional clinical information, besides imaging data such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), is usually required to reach a definitive diagnosis, including electrocardiography (ECG), family history, and genetics. Alternatively, indices of hypertrabeculation have been introduced, but they require tedious and time-consuming delineations of the trabeculae on the CMR images. In this paper, we propose a radiomics approach to automatically encode differences in the underlying shape, gray-scale and textural information in the myocardium and its trabeculae, which may enhance the capacity to differentiate between these overlapping conditions. A total of 118 subjects, including 35 patients with LVNC, 25 with HCM, 37 with DCM, as well as 21 healthy volunteers (NOR), underwent CMR imaging. A comprehensive radiomics characterization was applied to LV short-axis images to quantify shape, first-order, co-occurrence matrix, run-length matrix, and local binary patterns. Conventional CMR indices (LV volumes, mass, wall thickness, LV ejection fraction-LVEF-), as well as hypertrabeculation indices by Petersen and Jacquier, were also analyzed. State-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models (one-vs.-rest Support Vector Machine-SVM-, Logistic Regression-LR-, and Random Forest Classifier-RF-) were used for one-vs.-rest classification tasks. The use of radiomics models for the automated diagnosis of LVNC, HCM, and DCM resulted in excellent one-vs.-rest ROC-AUC values of 0.95 while generating these results without the need for the delineation of the trabeculae. First-order and texture features resulted to be among the most discriminative features in the obtained radiomics signatures, indicating their added value for quantifying relevant tissue patterns in cardiomyopathy differential diagnosis."
31570308,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,"Improving the clinical understanding of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by combining patient data, machine learning and computer simulations: A case study.","Most patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common genetic cardiac disease, remain asymptomatic, but others may suffer from sudden cardiac death. A better identification of those patients at risk, together with a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to arrhythmia, are crucial to target high-risk patients and provide them with appropriate treatment. However, this currently remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a successful example of implementing computational techniques for clinically-relevant applications. By combining electrocardiogram and imaging data, machine learning and high performance computing simulations, we identified four phenotypes in HCM, with differences in arrhythmic risk, and provided two distinct possible mechanisms that may explain the heterogeneity of HCM manifestation. This led to a better HCM patient stratification and understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms, providing a step further towards tailored HCM patient management and treatment."
9540323,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Using a neural network to diagnose the hypertrophic portions of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"We studied the ability of a neural network to identify the hypertrophic cardiac regions in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with the network using electrocardiographic (ECG) information alone. Computer-based electrocardiography remains a fundamental diagnostic method for analysis of cardiac contour and rhythm. Almost all patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have some abnormal findings on electrocardiography, but it is very difficult, even for an experienced cardiologist, to identify the hypertrophic regions on the basis of electrocardiography alone. Since neural networks are known to be better at pattern recognition than humans are, we tried using a neural network trained with ECG information to identify the hypertrophic regions in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
39581517,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,A Multicenter Evaluation of the Impact of Therapies on Deep Learning-Based Electrocardiographic Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Markers.,"Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography (AI-ECG) can identify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) on 12-lead ECGs and offers a novel way to monitor treatment response. Although the surgical or percutaneous reduction of the interventricular septum (SRT) represented initial HCM therapies, mavacamten offers an oral alternative. We aimed to assess the use of AI-ECG as a strategy to evaluate biologic responses to SRT and mavacamten. We applied an AI-ECG model for HCM detection to electrocardiography images from patients who underwent SRT across 3 sites: Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS), Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF), and Atlantic Health System (AHS) and to electrocardiography images from patients receiving mavacamten at YNHHS. A total of 70 patients underwent SRT at YNHHS, 100 at CCF, and 145 at AHS. At YNHHS, there was no significant change in the AI-ECG HCM score before versus after SRT (before SRT: median 0.55 [interquartile range 0.24 to 0.77] vs after SRT: 0.59 [0.40 to 0.75]). The AI-ECG HCM scores also did not improve after SRT at CCF (0.61 [0.32 to 0.79] vs 0.69 [0.52 to 0.79]) and AHS (0.52 [0.35 to 0.69] vs 0.61 [0.49 to 0.70]). Of the 36 YNHHS patients on mavacamten therapy, the median AI-ECG score before starting mavacamten was 0.41 (0.22 to 0.77), which decreased significantly to 0.28 (0.11 to 0.50, p <0.001 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test) at the end of a median follow-up period of 237 days. In conclusion, we observed a lack of improvement in AI-based HCM score with SRT, in contrast to a significant decrease with mavacamten. Our approach suggests the potential role of AI-ECG for serial point-of-care monitoring of pathophysiologic improvement after medical therapy in HCM using ECG images."
39147002,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Artificial intelligence-driven electrocardiography: Innovations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy management.,"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) presents a complex diagnostic and prognostic challenge due to its heterogeneous phenotype and clinical course. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques hold promise in transforming the role of Electrocardiography (ECG) in HCM diagnosis, prognosis, and management. AI, including Deep Learning (DL), enables computers to learn patterns from data, allowing for the development of models capable of analyzing ECG signals. DL models, such as convolutional neural networks, have shown promise in accurately identifying HCM-related abnormalities in ECGs, surpassing traditional diagnostic methods. In diagnosing HCM, ML models have demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing between HCM and other cardiac conditions, even in cases with normal ECG findings. Additionally, AI models have enhanced risk assessment by predicting arrhythmic events leading to sudden cardiac death and identifying patients at risk for atrial fibrillation and heart failure. These models incorporate clinical and imaging data, offering a comprehensive evaluation of patient risk profiles. Challenges remain, including the need for larger and more diverse datasets to improve model generalizability and address imbalances inherent in rare event prediction. Nevertheless, AI-driven approaches have the potential to revolutionize HCM management by providing timely and accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and personalized treatment strategies based on individual patient risk profiles. This review explores the current landscape of AI applications in ECG analysis for HCM, focusing on advancements in AI methodologies and their specific implementation in HCM care."
39081936,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy detection with artificial intelligence electrocardiography in international cohorts: an external validation study.,"AIMS: Recently, deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) models have been trained to detect cardiovascular conditions, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). In this external validation study, we sought to assess the performance of an AI-ECG algorithm for detecting HCM in diverse international cohorts. METHODS AND RESULTS: A convolutional neural network-based AI-ECG algorithm was developed previously in a single-centre North American HCM cohort (Mayo Clinic). This algorithm was applied to the raw 12-lead ECG data of patients with HCM and non-HCM controls from three external cohorts (Bern, Switzerland; Oxford, UK; and Seoul, South Korea). The algorithm's ability to distinguish HCM vs. non-HCM status from the ECG alone was examined. A total of 773 patients with HCM and 3867 non-HCM controls were included across three sites in the merged external validation cohort. The HCM study sample comprised 54.6% East Asian, 43.2% White, and 2.2% Black patients. Median AI-ECG probabilities of HCM were 85% for patients with HCM and 0.3% for controls (P < 0.001). Overall, the AI-ECG algorithm had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.922 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.910-0.934], with diagnostic accuracy 86.9%, sensitivity 82.8%, and specificity 87.7% for HCM detection. In age- and sex-matched analysis (case-control ratio 1:2), the AUC was 0.921 (95% CI 0.909-0.934) with accuracy 88.5%, sensitivity 82.8%, and specificity 90.4%. CONCLUSION: The AI-ECG algorithm determined HCM status from the 12-lead ECG with high accuracy in diverse international cohorts, providing evidence for external validity. The value of this algorithm in improving HCM detection in clinical practice and screening settings requires prospective evaluation."
38553520,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Evaluating convolutional neural network-enhanced electrocardiography for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy detection in a specialized cardiovascular setting.,"The efficacy of convolutional neural network (CNN)-enhanced electrocardiography (ECG) in detecting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated HCM (dHCM) remains uncertain in real-world applications. This retrospective study analyzed data from 19,170 patients (including 140 HCM or dHCM) in the Shinken Database (2010-2017). We evaluated the sensitivity, positive predictive rate (PPR), and F1 score of CNN-enhanced ECG in a ''basic diagnosis'' model (total disease label) and a ''comprehensive diagnosis'' model (including disease subtypes). Using all-lead ECG in the ""basic diagnosis"" model, we observed a sensitivity of 76%, PPR of 2.9%, and F1 score of 0.056. These metrics improved in cases with a diagnostic probability of >/= 0.9 and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on ECG: 100% sensitivity, 8.6% PPR, and 0.158 F1 score. The ''comprehensive diagnosis'' model further enhanced these figures to 100%, 13.0%, and 0.230, respectively. Performance was broadly consistent across CNN models using different lead configurations, particularly when including leads viewing the lateral walls. While the precision of CNN models in detecting HCM or dHCM in real-world settings is initially low, it improves by targeting specific patient groups and integrating disease subtype models. The use of ECGs with fewer leads, especially those involving the lateral walls, appears comparably effective."
38293023,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,A Multicenter Evaluation of the Impact of Therapies on Deep Learning-based Electrocardiographic Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Markers.,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography (AI-ECG) can identify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) on 12-lead ECGs and offers a novel way to monitor treatment response. While the surgical or percutaneous reduction of the interventricular septum (SRT) represented initial HCM therapies, mavacamten offers an oral alternative. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate biological response to SRT and mavacamten. METHODS: We applied an AI-ECG model for HCM detection to ECG images from patients who underwent SRT across three sites: Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS), Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF), and Atlantic Health System (AHS); and to ECG images from patients receiving mavacamten at YNHHS. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients underwent SRT at YNHHS, 100 at CCF, and 145 at AHS. At YNHHS, there was no significant change in the AI-ECG HCM score before versus after SRT (pre-SRT: median 0.55 [IQR 0.24-0.77] vs post-SRT: 0.59 [0.40-0.75]). The AI-ECG HCM scores also did not improve post SRT at CCF (0.61 [0.32-0.79] vs 0.69 [0.52-0.79]) and AHS (0.52 [0.35-0.69] vs 0.61 [0.49-0.70]). Among 36 YNHHS patients on mavacamten therapy, the median AI-ECG score before starting mavacamten was 0.41 (0.22-0.77), which decreased significantly to 0.28 (0.11-0.50, p <0.001 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test) at the end of a median follow-up period of 237 days. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of improvement in AI-based HCM score with SRT, in contrast to a significant decrease with mavacamten, suggests the potential role of AI-ECG for serial monitoring of pathophysiological improvement in HCM at the point-of-care using ECG images."
38280624,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Identification of high-risk imaging features in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using electrocardiography: A deep-learning approach.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are at risk of sudden death, and individuals with >/=1 major risk markers are considered for primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Guidelines recommend cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to identify high-risk imaging features. However, CMR imaging is resource intensive and is not widely accessible worldwide. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop electrocardiogram (ECG) deep-learning (DL) models for the identification of patients with HCM and high-risk imaging features. METHODS: Patients with HCM evaluated at Tufts Medical Center (N = 1930; Boston, MA) were used to develop ECG-DL models for the prediction of high-risk imaging features: systolic dysfunction, massive hypertrophy (>/=30 mm), apical aneurysm, and extensive late gadolinium enhancement. ECG-DL models were externally validated in a cohort of patients with HCM from the Amrita Hospital HCM Center (N = 233; Kochi, India). RESULTS: ECG-DL models reliably identified high-risk features (systolic dysfunction, massive hypertrophy, apical aneurysm, and extensive late gadolinium enhancement) during holdout testing (c-statistic 0.72, 0.83, 0.93, and 0.76) and external validation (c-statistic 0.71, 0.76, 0.91, and 0.68). A hypothetical screening strategy using echocardiography combined with ECG-DL-guided selective CMR use demonstrated a sensitivity of 97% for identifying patients with high-risk features while reducing the number of recommended CMRs by 61%. The negative predictive value with this screening strategy for the absence of high-risk features in patients without ECG-DL recommendation for CMR was 99.5%. CONCLUSION: In HCM, novel ECG-DL models reliably identified patients with high-risk imaging features while offering the potential to reduce CMR testing requirements in underresourced areas."
38234746,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Identification of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy on Electrocardiographic Images with Deep Learning.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects 1 in every 200 individuals and is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. HCM can be identified using an electrocardiogram (ECG) raw voltage data and deep learning approaches, but their point-of-care application is limited by the inaccessibility of these signal data. We developed a deep learning-based approach that overcomes this limitation and detects HCM from images of 12-lead ECGs across layouts. METHODS: We identified ECGs from patients with HCM features present on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) or those within 30 days of an echocardiogram documenting thickened interventricular septum (end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness > 15mm). Patients with CMR-confirmed HCM were considered as cases during the final model evaluation. The model was validated within clinical settings at YNHH and externally on ECG images from the prospective, population-based UK Biobank cohort. We localized class-discriminating signals in ECG images using gradient-weighted class activation mapping. RESULTS: Overall, 124,553 ECGs from 66,987 individuals (HCM cases and controls) were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination for HCM across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROC] 0.96) and external sets of ECG images from UK Biobank (AUROC 0.94). A positive screen for HCM was associated with a 100-fold higher odds of CMR-confirmed HCM (OR 102.4, 95% Confidence Interval, 57.4 - 182.6) in the held-out set. Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and lateral leads (V4-V5). CONCLUSIONS: We developed and externally validated a deep learning model that identifies HCM from ECG images with excellent discrimination. This approach represents an automated, efficient, and accessible screening strategy for HCM."
38076758,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Patient-Level Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Electrocardiography in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Longitudinal Treatment and Clinical Biomarker Correlations.,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to 12-lead electrocardiographs (ECGs) can detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine if AI-enhanced ECG (AI-ECG) can track longitudinal therapeutic response and changes in cardiac structure, function, or hemodynamics in obstructive HCM during mavacamten treatment. METHODS: We applied 2 independently developed AI-ECG algorithms (University of California-San Francisco and Mayo Clinic) to serial ECGs (n = 216) from the phase 2 PIONEER-OLE trial of mavacamten for symptomatic obstructive HCM (n = 13 patients, mean age 57.8 years, 69.2% male). Control ECGs from 2,600 age- and sex-matched individuals without HCM were obtained. AI-ECG output was correlated longitudinally to echocardiographic and laboratory metrics of mavacamten treatment response. RESULTS: In the validation cohorts, both algorithms exhibited similar performance for HCM diagnosis, and exhibited mean HCM score decreases during mavacamten treatment: patient-level score reduction ranged from approximately 0.80 to 0.45 for Mayo and 0.70 to 0.35 for USCF algorithms; 11 of 13 patients demonstrated absolute score reduction from start to end of follow-up for both algorithms. HCM scores were significantly associated with other HCM-relevant parameters, including left ventricular outflow tract gradient at rest, postexercise, and with Valsalva, and NT-proBNP level, independent of age and sex (all P < 0.01). For both algorithms, the strongest longitudinal correlation was between AI-ECG HCM score and left ventricular outflow tract gradient postexercise (slope estimate: University of California-San Francisco 0.70 [95% CI: 0.45-0.96], P < 0.0001; Mayo 0.40 [95% CI: 0.11-0.68], P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: AI-ECG analysis longitudinally correlated with changes in echocardiographic and laboratory markers during mavacamten treatment in obstructive HCM. These results provide early evidence for a potential paradigm for monitoring HCM therapeutic response."
38056911,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Model for classification of heart failure severity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using a deep neural network algorithm with a 12-lead electrocardiogram.,"OBJECTIVES: In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), specific ECG abnormalities are observed. Therefore, ECG is a valuable screening tool. Although several studies have reported on estimating the risk of developing fatal arrhythmias from ECG findings, the use of ECG to identify the severity of heart failure (HF) by applying deep learning (DL) methods has not been established. METHODS: We assessed whether data-driven machine-learning methods could effectively identify the severity of HF in patients with HCM. A residual neural network-based model was developed using 12-lead ECG data from 218 patients with HCM and 245 patients with non-HCM, categorised them into two (mild-to-moderate and severe) or three (mild, moderate and severe) severities of HF. These severities were defined according to the New York Heart Association functional class and levels of the N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide. In addition, the patients were divided into groups according to Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)-12. A transfer learning method was applied to resolve the issue of the low number of target samples. The model was trained in advance using PTB-XL, which is an open ECG dataset. RESULTS: The model trained with our dataset achieved a weighted average F1 score of 0.745 and precision of 0.750 for the mild-to-moderate class samples. Similar results were obtained for grouping based on KCCQ-12. Through data analyses using the Guided Gradient Weighted-Class Activation Map and Integrated Gradients, QRS waves were intensively highlighted among true-positive mild-to-moderate class cases, while the highlighted part was highly variable among true-positive severe class cases. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a model for classifying HF severity in patients with HCM using a deep neural network algorithm with 12-lead ECG data. Our findings suggest that applications of this DL algorithm for using 12-lead ECG data may be useful to classify the HF status in patients with HCM."
37599145,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Saliency maps provide insights into artificial intelligence-based electrocardiography models for detecting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"INTRODUCTION: A 12‑lead electrocardiography (ECG)-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model can detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, since these models do not rely on discrete measurements as inputs, it is not apparent what drives their performance. We hypothesized that saliency maps could be used to visually identify ECG segments that contribute to a CNN's robust classification of HCM. METHODS: We derived a new one‑lead (lead I) CNN model based on median beats using the same methodology and cohort used for the original 12‑lead CNN model (3047 patients with HCM, and 63,926 sex- and age-matched non-HCM controls). One‑lead, median-beat saliency maps were generated and visually evaluated in an independent cohort of 100 patients with a diagnosis of HCM and a high artificial intelligence (AI)-ECG-HCM probability score to determine which ECG segments contributed to the model's detection of HCM. RESULTS: The one‑lead, median-beat CNN had an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.89-0.92) for HCM detection, similar to the original 12‑lead ECG model. In the independent HCM cohort (n = 100), saliency maps highlighted the ST-T segment in 92 ECGs, the atrial depolarization segment in 12 ECGs, and the QRS complex in 5 ECGs. CONCLUSIONS: Saliency maps of a one‑lead, median-beat-based CNN model identified perturbations in ventricular repolarization as the main region of interest in detecting HCM."
37467172,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Deep learning-derived 12-lead electrocardiogram-based genotype prediction for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a pilot study.,"Objective: Given the psychosocial and ethical burden, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMs) could benefit from the establishment of genetic probability prior to the test. This study aimed to develop a simple tool to provide genotype prediction for HCMs.Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was built with the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) of 124 HCMs who underwent genetic testing (GT), externally tested by predicting the genotype on another HCMs cohort (n = 54), and compared with the conventional methods (the Mayo and Toronto score). Using a third cohort of HCMs (n = 76), the role of the network in risk stratification was explored by calculating the sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk scorers (HCM risk-SCD) across the predicted genotypes. Score-CAM was employed to provide a visual explanation of the network.Results: Overall, 80 of 178 HCMs (45%) were genotype-positive. Using the 12-lead ECG as input, the network showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96) on the test set, outperforming the Mayo score (0.69 [95% CI, 0.65-0.78], p < 0.001) and the Toronto score (0.69 [95% CI, 0.64-0.75], p < 0.001). The network classified the third cohort into two groups (predicted genotype-negative vs. predicted genotype-positive). Compared with the former, patients predicted genotype-positive had a significantly higher HCM risk-SCD (0.04 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.03 +/- 0.02, p <0.01). Visualization indicated that the prediction was heavily influenced by the limb lead.Conclusions: The network demonstrated a promising ability in genotype prediction and risk assessment in HCM."
37152425,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Identification of patients with dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using a convolutional neural network applied to multiple, dual, and single lead electrocardiograms.","BACKGROUND: This study sought to develop an artificial intelligence-derived model to detect the dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (dHCM) on digital electrocardiography (ECG) and to evaluate the performance of the model applied to multiple-lead or single-lead ECG. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis using a single-center prospective cohort study (Shinken Database 2010-2017, n = 19,170). After excluding those without a normal P wave on index ECG (n = 1,831) and adding dHCM patients registered before 2009 (n = 39), 17,378 digital ECGs were used. Totally 54 dHCM patients were identified of which 11 diagnosed at baseline, 4 developed during the time course, and 39 registered before 2009. The performance of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting dHCM was evaluated using eight-lead (I, II, and V1-6), single-lead, and double-lead (I, II) ECGs with the five-fold cross validation method. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of the CNN model to detect dHCM (n = 54) with eight-lead ECG was 0.929 (standard deviation [SD]: 0.025) and the odds ratio was 38.64 (SD 9.10). Among the single-lead and double-lead ECGs, the AUC was highest with the single lead of V5 (0.953 [SD: 0.038]), with an odds ratio of 58.89 (SD:68.56). CONCLUSION: Compared with the performance of eight-lead ECG, the most similar performance was achieved with the model with a single V5 lead, suggesting that this single-lead ECG can be an alternative to eight-lead ECG for the screening of dHCM."
35916132,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Multinational Federated Learning Approach to Train ECG and Echocardiogram Models for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Detection.,"BACKGROUND: Novel targeted treatments increase the need for prompt hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) detection. However, its low prevalence (0.5%) and resemblance to common diseases present challenges that may benefit from automated machine learning-based approaches. We aimed to develop machine learning models to detect HCM and to differentiate it from other cardiac conditions using ECGs and echocardiograms, with robust generalizability across multiple cohorts. METHODS: Single-institution HCM ECG models were trained and validated on external data. Multi-institution models for ECG and echocardiogram were trained on data from 3 academic medical centers in the United States and Japan using a federated learning approach, which enables training on distributed data without data sharing. Models were validated on held-out test sets for each institution and from a fourth academic medical center and were further evaluated for discrimination of HCM from aortic stenosis, hypertension, and cardiac amyloidosis. Last, automated detection was compared with manual interpretation by 3 cardiologists on a data set with a realistic HCM prevalence. RESULTS: We identified 74 376 ECGs for 56 129 patients and 8392 echocardiograms for 6825 patients at the 4 academic medical centers. Although ECG models trained on data from each institution displayed excellent discrimination of HCM on internal test data (C statistics, 0.88-0.93), the generalizability was limited, most notably for a model trained in Japan and tested in the United States (C statistic, 0.79-0.82). When trained in a federated manner, discrimination of HCM was excellent across all institutions (C statistics, 0.90-0.96 and 0.90-0.96 for ECG and echocardiogram model, respectively), including for phenotypic subgroups. The models further discriminated HCM from hypertension, aortic stenosis, and cardiac amyloidosis (C statistics, 0.84, 0.83, and 0.88, respectively, for ECG and 0.93, 0.94, 0.85, respectively, for echocardiogram). Analysis of electrocardiography-echocardiography paired data from 11 823 patients from an external institution indicated a higher sensitivity of automated HCM detection at a given positive predictive value compared with cardiologists (0.98 versus 0.81 at a positive predictive value of 0.01 for ECG and 0.78 versus 0.59 at a positive predictive value of 0.24 for echocardiogram). CONCLUSIONS: Federated learning improved the generalizability of models that use ECGs and echocardiograms to detect and differentiate HCM from other causes of hypertrophy compared with training within a single institution."

34419527,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Detection of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by an artificial intelligence electrocardiogram in children and adolescents.,"BACKGROUND: There is no established screening approach for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We recently developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model for the detection of HCM based on the 12‑lead electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) in adults. Here, we aimed to validate this approach of ECG-based HCM detection in pediatric patients (age </= 18 years). METHODS: We identified a cohort of 300 children and adolescents with HCM (mean age 12.5 +/- 4.6 years, male 68%) who had an ECG and echocardiogram at our institution. Patients were age- and sex-matched to 18,439 non-HCM controls. Diagnostic performance of the AI-ECG model for the detection of HCM was estimated using the previously identified optimal diagnostic threshold of 11% (the probability output derived by the model above which an ECG is considered to belong to an HCM patient). RESULTS: Mean AI-ECG probabilities of HCM were 92% and 5% in the case and control groups, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the AI-ECG model for HCM detection was 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99) with corresponding sensitivity 92% and specificity 95%. The positive and negative predictive values were 22% and 99%, respectively. The model performed similarly in males and females and in genotype-positive and genotype-negative HCM patients. Performance tended to be superior with increasing age. In the age subgroup <5 years, the test's AUC was 0.93. In comparison, the AUC was 0.99 in the age subgroup 15-18 years. CONCLUSIONS: A deep-learning, AI model can detect pediatric HCM with high accuracy from the standard 12‑lead ECG."
32081280,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Detection of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Using a Convolutional Neural Network-Enabled Electrocardiogram.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an uncommon but important cause of sudden cardiac death. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to develop an artificial intelligence approach for the detection of HCM based on 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG). METHODS: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained and validated using digital 12-lead ECG from 2,448 patients with a verified HCM diagnosis and 51,153 non-HCM age- and sex-matched control subjects. The ability of the CNN to detect HCM was then tested on a different dataset of 612 HCM and 12,788 control subjects. RESULTS: In the combined datasets, mean age was 54.8 +/- 15.9 years for the HCM group and 57.5 +/- 15.5 years for the control group. After training and validation, the area under the curve (AUC) of the CNN in the validation dataset was 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94 to 0.97) at the optimal probability threshold of 11% for having HCM. When applying this probability threshold to the testing dataset, the CNN's AUC was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95 to 0.96) with sensitivity 87% and specificity 90%. In subgroup analyses, the AUC was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.94 to 0.97) among patients with left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG criteria and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.00) among patients with a normal ECG. The model performed particularly well in younger patients (sensitivity 95%, specificity 92%). In patients with HCM with and without sarcomeric mutations, the model-derived median probabilities for having HCM were 97% and 96%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ECG-based detection of HCM by an artificial intelligence algorithm can be achieved with high diagnostic performance, particularly in younger patients. This model requires further refinement and external validation, but it may hold promise for HCM screening."
29593570,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Distinct ECG Phenotypes Identified in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Using Machine Learning Associate With Arrhythmic Risk Markers.,"Aims: Ventricular arrhythmia triggers sudden cardiac death (SCD) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), yet electrophysiological biomarkers are not used for risk stratification. Our aim was to identify distinct HCM phenotypes based on ECG computational analysis, and characterize differences in clinical risk factors and anatomical differences using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Methods: High-fidelity 12-lead Holter ECGs from 85 HCM patients and 38 healthy volunteers were analyzed using mathematical modeling and computational clustering to identify phenotypic subgroups. Clinical features and the extent and distribution of hypertrophy assessed by CMR were evaluated in the subgroups. Results: QRS morphology alone was crucial to identify three HCM phenotypes with very distinct QRS patterns. Group 1 (n = 44) showed normal QRS morphology, Group 2 (n = 19) showed short R and deep S waves in V4, and Group 3 (n = 22) exhibited short R and long S waves in V4-6, and left QRS axis deviation. However, no differences in arrhythmic risk or distribution of hypertrophy were observed between these groups. Including T wave biomarkers in the clustering, four HCM phenotypes were identified: Group 1A (n = 20), with primary repolarization abnormalities showing normal QRS yet inverted T waves, Group 1B (n = 24), with normal QRS morphology and upright T waves, and Group 2 and Group 3 remaining as before, with upright T waves. Group 1A patients, with normal QRS and inverted T wave, showed increased HCM Risk-SCD scores (1A: 4.0%, 1B: 1.8%, 2: 2.1%, 3: 2.5%, p = 0.0001), and a predominance of coexisting septal and apical hypertrophy (p < 0.0001). HCM patients in Groups 2 and 3 exhibited predominantly septal hypertrophy (85 and 90%, respectively). Conclusion: HCM patients were classified in four subgroups with distinct ECG features. Patients with primary T wave inversion not secondary to QRS abnormalities had increased HCM Risk-SCD scores and coexisting septal and apical hypertrophy, suggesting that primary T wave inversion may increase SCD risk in HCM, rather than T wave inversion secondary to depolarization abnormalities. Computational ECG phenotyping provides insight into the underlying processes captured by the ECG and has the potential to be a novel and independent factor for risk stratification."
25915962,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Utilizing ECG-Based Heartbeat Classification for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Identification.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a cardiovascular disease where the heart muscle is partially thickened and blood flow is (potentially fatally) obstructed. A test based on electrocardiograms (ECG) that record the heart electrical activity can help in early detection of HCM patients. This paper presents a cardiovascular-patient classifier we developed to identify HCM patients using standard 10-second, 12-lead ECG signals. Patients are classified as having HCM if the majority of their recorded heartbeats are recognized as characteristic of HCM. Thus, the classifier's underlying task is to recognize individual heartbeats segmented from 12-lead ECG signals as HCM beats, where heartbeats from non-HCM cardiovascular patients are used as controls. We extracted 504 morphological and temporal features-both commonly used and newly-developed ones-from ECG signals for heartbeat classification. To assess classification performance, we trained and tested a random forest classifier and a support vector machine classifier using 5-fold cross validation. We also compared the performance of these two classifiers to that obtained by a logistic regression classifier, and the first two methods performed better than logistic regression. The patient-classification precision of random forests and of support vector machine classifiers is close to 0.85. Recall (sensitivity) and specificity are approximately 0.90. We also conducted feature selection experiments by gradually removing the least informative features; the results show that a relatively small subset of 264 highly informative features can achieve performance measures comparable to those achieved by using the complete set of features."

35582082,Yes,No,No,No,Late occurrence of ventricular septal rupture after deep septal myectomy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Causes and management.,"Surgical septal myectomy is increasingly utilized for patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy who remain symptomatic despite maximum doses of medical therapy. Deep and extensive septal muscle resections may lead to iatrogenic ventricular septal defects that are detected on transesophageal echocardiography immediately after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass and immediately corrected in the same surgery. However markedly thinned out ventricular septum after myectomy may be prone to late rupture from high left ventricular systolic pressures causing delayed detection of a ventricular septal defect when the patients present with new onset symptoms. Additionally, a surgical injury to the first septal perforator artery during the myocardial resection leading to septal infarction may contribute to delayed occurrence of ventricular septal defect. Such a predisposing deep septal resection or septal infarction may be associated with varying degrees of atrioventricular nodal block warranting a permanent pacing. A new onset interventricular shunt from such an iatrogenic ventricular septal defect often leads to heart failure as the filling pressures increase disproportionately in the thick hypertrophied left ventricle. Transcatheter closure is an alternative to a high-risk repeat surgery. This report of device closure of two delayed septal ruptures after myectomy discusses the reasons, presentation, catheter approaches, and procedural challenges. <Learning objective: Deep extended septal myectomy for medically refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may lead to early or late iatrogenic ventricular septal defect. Such an extensive loss of septal muscle may be additionally indicated by co-occurrence of atrioventricular nodal block that needs permanent pacing. Heart failure from the new onset interventricular shunt is not clinically tolerated by the hypertrophied left ventricle due to elevated end diastolic pressures. Transcatheter closure of the ventricular septal defect is an attractive alternative to a morbid repeat surgery.>."

39742214,No,Yes,No,No,Progress in the Clinical Application of Artificial Intelligence for Left Ventricle Analysis in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance.,"Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging enables a one-stop assessment of heart structure and function. Artificial intelligence (AI) can simplify and automate work flows and improve image post-processing speed and diagnostic accuracy; thus, it greatly affects many aspects of CMR. This review highlights the application of AI for left heart analysis in CMR, including quality control, image segmentation, and global and regional functional assessment. Most recent research has focused on segmentation of the left ventricular myocardium and blood pool. Although many algorithms have shown a level comparable to that of human experts, some problems, such as poor performance of basal and apical segmentation and false identification of myocardial structure, remain. Segmentation of myocardial fibrosis is another research hotspot, and most patient cohorts of such studies have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Whether the above methods are applicable to other patient groups requires further study. The use of automated CMR interpretation for the diagnosis and prognosis assessment of cardiovascular diseases demonstrates great clinical potential. However, prospective large-scale clinical trials are needed to investigate the real-word application of AI technology in clinical practice."
39694574,No,Yes,No,No,Detection of cardiac amyloidosis using machine learning on routine echocardiographic measurements.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is an underdiagnosed, progressive and lethal disease. Machine learning applied to common measurements derived from routine echocardiogram studies can inform suspicion of CA. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to test a random forest (RF) model in detecting CA. METHODS: We used 3603 echocardiogram studies from 636 patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to train an RF model to predict CA from echocardiographic parameters. 231 patients with CA were compared with 405 control patients with negative pyrophosphate scans or clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 19 common echocardiographic measurements from echocardiogram reports were used as input into the RF model. Data was split by patient into a training data set of 2882 studies from 486 patients and a test data set of 721 studies from 150 patients. The performance of the model was evaluated by area under the receiver operative curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) on the test data set. RESULTS: The RF model identified CA with an AUC of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.82, specificity of 0.73 and PPV of 0.76. Some echocardiographic measurements had high missingness, suggesting gaps in measurement in routine clinical practice. Features that were large contributors to the model included mitral A-wave velocity, global longitudinal strain (GLS), left ventricle posterior wall diameter end diastolic (LVPWd) and left atrial area. CONCLUSION: Machine learning on echocardiographic parameters can detect patients with CA with accuracy. Our model identified several features that were major contributors towards identifying CA including GLS, mitral A peak velocity and LVPWd. Further study is needed to evaluate its external validity and application in clinical settings."
39641685,No,Yes,No,No,Leveraging a Vision Transformer Model to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy of Cardiac Amyloidosis With Cardiac Magnetic Resonance.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is an important diagnostic tool for diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis (CA). However, discrimination of CA from other etiologies of myocardial disease can be challenging. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop and rigorously validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm to aid in the discrimination of CA using cine and late gadolinium enhancement CMR imaging. METHODS: A DL model using a retrospective cohort of 807 patients who were referred for CMR for suspicion of infiltrative disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was developed. Confirmed definitive diagnosis was as follows: 252 patients with CA, 290 patients with HCM, and 265 with neither CA or HCM (other). This cohort was split 70/30 into training and test sets. A vision transformer (ViT) model was trained primarily to identify CA. The model was validated in an external cohort of 157 patients also referred for CMR for suspicion of infiltrative disease or HCM (51 CA, 49 HCM, 57 other). RESULTS: The ViT model achieved a diagnostic accuracy (84.1%) and an area under the curve of 0.954 in the internal testing data set. The ViT model further demonstrated an accuracy of 82.8% and an area under the curve of 0.957 in the external testing set. The ViT model achieved an accuracy of 90% (n = 55 of 61), among studies with clinical reports with moderate/high confidence diagnosis of CA, and 61.1% (n = 22 of 36) among studies with reported uncertain, missing, or incorrect diagnosis of CA in the internal cohort. DL accuracy of this cohort increased to 79.1% when studies with poor image quality, dual pathologies, or ambiguity of clinically significant CA diagnosis were removed. CONCLUSIONS: A ViT model using only cine and late gadolinium enhancement CMR images can achieve high accuracy in differentiating CA from other underlying etiologies of suspected cardiomyopathy, especially in cases when reported human diagnostic confidence was uncertain in both a large single state health system and in an external CA cohort."
39480584,No,Yes,No,No,Using machine learning approaches to develop a fast and easy-to-perform diagnostic tool for patients with light chain amyloidosis: a retrospective real-world study.,"Immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a severe disorder caused by the accumulation of amyloid fibrils, leading to organ failure. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent irreversible damage, yet it remains a challenge due to nonspecific symptoms that often appear later in the disease progression. A retrospective study analyzed data collected from 133 AL amyloidosis patients and 271 non-AL patients with similar symptoms but different diagnoses between January 1st, 2017, and September 30th, 2022. Demographic data and laboratory test results were collected. Subsequently, significant features were identified by both logistic regression and independent expert clinical ability. Eventually, logistic regression and four machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to construct a diagnostic model, utilizing fivefold cross-validation and blind set testing to identify the optimal model. The study successfully identified nine independent predictors of AL amyloidosis patients with kidney or cardiac involvement, respectively. Two models were developed to identify key features that distinguish AL amyloidosis from nephrotic syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respectively. The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) model emerged as the most effective, demonstrating superior performance with the area under curve (AUC) of 0.90 in both models, alongside high sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. This research highlights the potential of using a machine learning-based LightGBM model to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. The model's effectiveness suggests it could be a valuable tool in clinical settings, aiding in the timely identification of AL amyloidosis among patients with non-specific symptoms. Further validation in diverse populations is recommended to establish its universal applicability."
39469763,No,Yes,No,No,Cardiovascular Disease Pathogenicity Predictor (CVD-PP): A Tissue-Specific In Silico Tool for Discriminating Pathogenicity of Variants of Unknown Significance in Cardiovascular Disease Genes.,"BACKGROUND: Interpretation of variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) remains a challenge in the care of patients with inherited cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); 56% of variants within CVD risk genes are VUS, and machine learning algorithms trained upon large data resources can stratify VUS into higher versus lower probability of contributing to a CVD phenotype. METHODS: We used ClinVar pathogenic/likely pathogenic and benign/likely benign variants from 47 CVD genes to build a predictive model of variant pathogenicity utilizing measures of evolutionary constraint, deleteriousness, splicogenicity, local pathogenicity, cardiac-specific expression, and population allele frequency. Performance was validated using variants for which the ClinVar pathogenicity assignment changed. Functional validation was assessed using prior studies in >900 identified VUS. The model utility was demonstrated using the Catheterization Genetics (CATHGEN) cohort. RESULTS: We identified a top-ranked model that accurately prioritized variants for which ClinVar clinical significance had changed (n=663; precision-recall area under the curve, 0.97) and performed well compared with conventional in silico methods. This model (CVD pathogenicity predictor [CVD-PP]) also had high accuracy in prioritizing VUS with functional effects in vivo (precision-recall area under the curve, 0.58). In CATHGEN, there was a greater burden of higher CVD-PP scored VUS in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy compared with controls (P=8.2x10(-)(15)). Of individuals in CATHGEN who harbored highly ranked CVD pathogenicity predictor VUS meeting clinical pathogenicity criteria, 27.6% had clinical evidence of disease. Variant prioritization using this model increased genetic diagnosis in CATHGEN participants with a known clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (7.8%-27.2%). CONCLUSIONS: We present a cardiac-specific model for prioritizing variants underlying CVD syndromes with high performance in discriminating the pathogenicity of VUS in CVD genes. Variant review and phenotyping of individuals carrying VUS of pathogenic interest support the clinical utility of this model. This model could also have utility in filtering variants as part of large-scale genomic sequencing studies."

39353848,No,Yes,No,No,Deep-Learning-Based Disease Classification in Patients Undergoing Cine Cardiac MRI.,"BACKGROUND: Automated approaches may allow for fast, reproducible clinical assessment of cardiovascular diseases from MRI. PURPOSE: To develop an MRI-based deep learning (DL) disease classification algorithm to distinguish among normal subjects (NORM), patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and ischemic heart disease (IHD). STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: A total of 1337 subjects (55% female), comprising normal subjects (N = 568), and patients with DCM (N = 151), HCM (N = 177), and IHD (N = 441). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Balanced steady-state free precession cine sequence at 1.5/3.0 T. ASSESSMENT: Bi-ventricular morphological and functional features and global and segmental left ventricular strain features were automatically extracted from short- and long-axis cine images. Variational autoencoder models were trained on the extracted features and compared against consensus disease label provided by two expert readers (13 and 14 years of experience). Adding unlabeled, normal data to the training was explored to increase specificity of NORM class. STATISTICAL TESTS: Tenfold cross-validation for model development; mean, standard deviation (SD) for measurements; classification metrics: area under the curve (AUC), confusion matrix, accuracy, specificity, precision, recall; 95% confidence intervals; Mann-Whitney U test for significance. RESULTS: AUCs of 0.952 for NORM, 0.881 for DCM, 0.908 for HCM, and 0.856 for IHD and overall accuracy of 0.778 were obtained, with specificity of 0.908 for the NORM class using both SAX and LAX features. Longitudinal strain features slightly improved classification metrics by 0.001 to 0.03 points, except for HCM-AUC. Differences in accuracy, metrics for NORM class and HCM-AUC were statistically significant. Cotraining using unlabeled data increased the specificity for the NORM class to 0.961. DATA CONCLUSION: Cardiac function features automatically extracted from cine MRI have potential to be used for disease classification, especially for normal-abnormal classification. Feature analyses showed that strain features were important for disease labeling. Cotraining using unlabeled data may help to increase specificity for normal-abnormal classification.

39330450,No,Yes,No,No,The Role of Cardiovascular Imaging in the Diagnosis of Athlete's Heart: Navigating the Shades of Grey.,"Athlete's heart (AH) represents the heart's remarkable ability to adapt structurally and functionally to prolonged and intensive athletic training. Characterized by increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, enlarged cardiac chambers, and augmented cardiac mass, AH typically maintains or enhances systolic and diastolic functions. Despite the positive health implications, these adaptations can obscure the difference between benign physiological changes and early manifestations of cardiac pathologies such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). This article reviews the imaging characteristics of AH across various modalities, emphasizing echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and cardiac computed tomography as primary tools for evaluating cardiac function and distinguishing physiological adaptations from pathological conditions. The findings highlight the need for precise diagnostic criteria and advanced imaging techniques to ensure accurate differentiation, preventing misdiagnosis and its associated risks, such as sudden cardiac death (SCD). Understanding these adaptations and employing the appropriate imaging methods are crucial for athletes' effective management and health optimization."
39202774,No,Yes,No,No,Machine Learning in Identifying Marker Genes for Congenital Heart Diseases of Different Cardiac Cell Types.,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) represents a spectrum of inborn heart defects influenced by genetic and environmental factors. This study advances the field by analyzing gene expression profiles in 21,034 cardiac fibroblasts, 73,296 cardiomyocytes, and 35,673 endothelial cells, utilizing single-cell level analysis and machine learning techniques. Six CHD conditions: dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), donor hearts (used as healthy controls), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), heart failure with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HF_HLHS), Neonatal Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (Neo_HLHS), and Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), were investigated for each cardiac cell type. Each cell sample was represented by 29,266 gene features. These features were first analyzed by six feature-ranking algorithms, resulting in several feature lists. Then, these lists were fed into incremental feature selection, containing two classification algorithms, to extract essential gene features and classification rules and build efficient classifiers. The identified essential genes can be potential CHD markers in different cardiac cell types. For instance, the LASSO identified key genes specific to various heart cell types in CHD subtypes. FOXO3 was found to be up-regulated in cardiac fibroblasts for both Dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In cardiomyocytes, distinct genes such as TMTC1, ART3, ARHGAP24, SHROOM3, and XIST were linked to dilated cardiomyopathy, Neo-Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, HF-Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, and Tetralogy of Fallot, respectively. Endothelial cell analysis further revealed COL25A1, NFIB, and KLF7 as significant genes for dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and Tetralogy of Fallot. LightGBM, Catboost, MCFS, RF, and XGBoost further delineated key genes for specific CHD subtypes, demonstrating the efficacy of machine learning in identifying CHD-specific genes. Additionally, this study developed quantitative rules for representing the gene expression patterns related to CHDs. This research underscores the potential of machine learning in unraveling the molecular complexities of CHD and establishes a foundation for future mechanism-based studies."
39164512,No,Yes,No,No,A Real‑World Pharmacovigilance Study of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) for Mavacamten.,"BACKGROUND: Mavacamten is a first-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This pharmacovigilance study aimed to assess mavacamten-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the real world as reported in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). METHODS: We conducted disproportionality analyses with four signal detection algorithms-reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker to identify mavacamten-related ADRs. RESULTS: Out of 4,500,131 reports from the FAERS database, 1004 mavacamten-related ADRs were identified from 1 January 2022 to 30 September 2023. A total of 26 significant disproportionality preferred terms (PTs) conforming to the four signal detection algorithms were noted. Some of the statistically significant cardiac ADRs at PT level include decreased ejection fraction (EF) [ROR 33.60 (95% confidence interval, CI 21.79-51.82), PRR 32.86 (chi(2) 615.96), information component (IC) 5.03, IC025 4.61, empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) 32.77, EBGM05 21.25], cardiac failure [ROR 9.39 (95% CI 6.49-13.60), PRR 9.13 (chi(2) 202.42), IC 3.19, IC025 2.83, EBGM 9.12, EBGM05 6.30], and atrial fibrillation [ROR 16.63 (95% CI 12.72-21.75), PRR 15.66 (chi(2) 769.93), IC 3.97, IC025 3.71, EBGM 15.64, EBGM05 11.96]. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study were consistent with the safety data of clinical trials, including reduced ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, dyspnea, and syncope. We also found potential new and unexpected ADR signals, such as urinary tract infection, gout, and peripheral edema."
39122099,No,Yes,No,No,Mavacamten in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: Prospects for AI integration and mitigating healthcare disparities.,"Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is an autosomal dominant condition that still remains significantly under-diagnosed worldwide. Early detection through clinical evaluation, imaging, and familial history is crucial to prevent severe complications such as heart failure and sudden cardiac death. While cuddsnt management strategies primarily offer symptomatic relief through pharmacotherapy or invasive procedures, their effectiveness and accessibility are limited, revealing substantial gaps in care. The emergence of Mavacamten, a recently FDA-approved drug, could potentially revolutionize HOCM management as it addresses the underlying pathophysiology by inhibiting cardiac myosin ATPase, showing promise in reducing obstruction and improving cardiac function. Our review aims to assess mavacamten's efficacy, emphasizing the pivotal role of genetic testing in identifying at-risk individuals and guiding precise diagnoses for personalized treatments. Additionally, we aim to highlight disparities in access to advanced diagnostics and therapies, particularly affecting underserved populations globally and within communities, as well as explore the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing early detection and monitoring treatment responses in HOCM. This review thus offers valuable insights to inform future research directions and clinical practices aimed at optimizing outcomes for individuals with HOCM."
39070560,No,Yes,No,No,Research landscape of genetics in dilated cardiomyopathy: insight from a bibliometric analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heterogeneous myocardial disorder with diverse genetic or acquired origins. Notable advances have been achieved in discovering and understanding the genetics of DCM. This study aimed to depict the distribution of the main research forces, hotspots, and frontiers in the genetics of DCM, thus shaping future research directions. METHODS: Based on the documents published in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2013 to 2022, co-authorship of authors, institutions, and countries/regions, co-citation of references, and co-occurrence of keywords were conducted respectively to present the distribution of the leading research forces, research hotspots, and emerging trends in the genetics of DCM. RESULTS: 4,141 documents were included, and the annual publications have steadily increased. Seidman, Christine E, Meder, Benjamin, Sinagra, Gianfranco were the most productive authors, German Centre for Cardiovascular Research was the most productive institution, and the USA, China, and Germany were the most prolific countries. The co-occurrence of keywords has generated 8 clusters, including DCM, lamin a/c, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, and next-generation sequencing. Frequent keywords with average publication time after 2019 mainly included arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, whole-exome sequencing, RBM 20, phenotype, risk stratification, precision medicine, genotype, and machine learning. CONCLUSION: The research landscape of genetics in DCM is continuously evolving. Deciphering the genetic profiles by next-generation sequencing and illustrating pathogenic mechanisms of gene variants, establishing innovative treatments for heart failure and improved risk stratification for SCD, uncovering the genetic overlaps between DCM and other inherited cardiomyopathies, as well as identifying genotype-phenotype correlations are the main research hotspots and frontiers in this field."
39062799,No,Yes,No,No,A Rare Coincidence of Three Inherited Diseases in a Family with Cardiomyopathy and Multiple Extracardiac Abnormalities.,"A genetic diagnosis of primary cardiomyopathies can be a long-unmet need in patients with complex phenotypes. We investigated a three-generation family with cardiomyopathy and various extracardiac abnormalities that had long sought a precise diagnosis. The 41-year-old proband had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), left ventricular noncompaction, myocardial fibrosis, arrhythmias, and a short stature. His sister showed HCM, myocardial hypertrabeculation and fibrosis, sensorineural deafness, and congenital genitourinary malformations. Their father had left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The proband's eldest daughter demonstrated developmental delay and seizures. We performed a clinical examination and whole-exome sequencing for all available family members. All patients with HCM/LVH shared a c.4411-2A>C variant in ALPK3, a recently known HCM-causative gene. Functional studies confirmed that this variant alters ALPK3 canonical splicing. Due to extracardiac symptoms in the female patients, we continued the search and found two additional single-gene disorders. The proband's sister had a p.Trp329Gly missense in GATA3, linked to hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal dysplasia; his daughter had a p.Ser251del in WDR45, associated with beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration. This unique case of three monogenic disorders in one family shows how a comprehensive approach with thorough phenotyping and extensive genetic testing of all symptomatic individuals provides precise diagnoses and appropriate follow-up, embodying the concept of personalized medicine. We also present the first example of a splicing functional study for ALPK3 and describe the genotype-phenotype correlations in cardiomyopathy."
38944903,No,Yes,No,No,Deriving phenotype-representative left ventricular flow patterns by reduced-order modeling and classification.,"BACKGROUND: Extracting phenotype-representative flow patterns and their associated numerical metrics is a bottleneck in the clinical translation of advanced cardiac flow imaging modalities. We hypothesized that reduced-order models (ROMs) are a suitable strategy for deriving simple and interpretable clinical metrics of intraventricular flow suitable for further assessments. Combined with machine learning (ML) flow-based ROMs could provide new insight to help diagnose and risk-stratify patients. METHODS: We analyzed 2D color-Doppler echocardiograms of 81 non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients, 51 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients, and 77 normal volunteers (Control). We applied proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to build patient-specific and cohort-specific ROMs of LV flow. Each ROM aggregates a low number of components representing a spatially dependent velocity map modulated along the cardiac cycle by a time-dependent coefficient. We tested three classifiers using deliberately simple ML analyses of these ROMs with varying supervision levels. In supervised models, hyperparameter grid search was used to derive the ROMs that maximize classification power. The classifiers were blinded to LV chamber geometry and function. We ran vector flow mapping on the color-Doppler sequences to help visualize flow patterns and interpret the ML results. RESULTS: POD-based ROMs stably represented each cohort through 10-fold cross-validation. The principal POD mode captured >80 % of the flow kinetic energy (KE) in all cohorts and represented the LV filling/emptying jets. Mode 2 represented the diastolic vortex and its KE contribution ranged from <1 % (HCM) to 13 % (DCM). Semi-unsupervised classification using patient-specific ROMs revealed that the KE ratio of these two principal modes, the vortex-to-jet (V2J) energy ratio, is a simple, interpretable metric that discriminates DCM, HCM, and Control patients. Receiver operating characteristic curves using V2J as classifier had areas under the curve of 0.81, 0.91, and 0.95 for distinguishing HCM vs. Control, DCM vs. Control, and DCM vs. HCM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Modal decomposition of cardiac flow can be used to create ROMs of normal and pathological flow patterns, uncovering simple interpretable flow metrics with power to discriminate disease states, and particularly suitable for further processing using ML."
38798507,No,Yes,No,No,Deconvolution of polygenic risk score in single cells unravels cellular and molecular heterogeneity of complex human diseases.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are commonly used for predicting an individual's genetic risk of complex diseases. Yet, their implication for disease pathogenesis remains largely limited. Here, we introduce scPRS, a geometric deep learning model that constructs single-cell-resolved PRS leveraging reference single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling data to enhance biological discovery as well as disease prediction. Real-world applications across multiple complex diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and Alzheimer's disease (AD), showcase the superior prediction power of scPRS compared to traditional PRS methods. Importantly, scPRS not only predicts disease risk but also uncovers disease-relevant cells, such as hormone-high alpha and beta cells for T2D, cardiomyocytes and pericytes for HCM, and astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells for AD. Facilitated by a layered multi-omic analysis, scPRS further identifies cell-type-specific genetic underpinnings, linking disease-associated genetic variants to gene regulation within corresponding cell types. We substantiate the disease relevance of scPRS-prioritized HCM genes and demonstrate that the suppression of these genes in HCM cardiomyocytes is rescued by Mavacamten treatment. Additionally, we establish a novel microglia-specific regulatory relationship between the AD risk variant rs7922621 and its target genes ANXA11 and TSPAN14. We further illustrate the detrimental effects of suppressing these two genes on microglia phagocytosis. Our work provides a multi-tasking, interpretable framework for precise disease prediction and systematic investigation of the genetic, cellular, and molecular basis of complex diseases, laying the methodological foundation for single-cell genetics."
38789141,No,Yes,No,No,Prediction of diagnosis and diastolic filling pressure by AI-enhanced cardiac MRI: a modelling study of hospital data.,"BACKGROUND: With increasing numbers of patients and novel drugs for distinct causes of systolic and diastolic heart failure, automated assessment of cardiac function is important. We aimed to provide a non-invasive method to predict diagnosis of patients undergoing cardiac MRI (cMRI) and to obtain left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). METHODS: For this modelling study, patients who had undergone cardiac catheterisation at University Hospital Heidelberg (Heidelberg, Germany) between July 15, 2004 and March 16, 2023, were identified, as were individual left ventricular pressure measurements. We used existing patient data from routine cardiac diagnostics. From this initial group, we extracted patients who had been diagnosed with ischaemic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or amyloidosis, as well as control individuals with no structural phenotype. Data were pseudonymised and only processed within the university hospital's AI infrastructure. We used the data to build different models to predict either demographic (ie, AI-age and AI-sex), diagnostic (ie, AI-coronary artery disease and AI-cardiomyopathy [AI-CMP]), or functional parameters (ie, AI-LVEDP). We randomly divided our datasets via computer into training, validation, and test datasets. AI-CMP was not compared with other models, but was validated in a prospective setting. Benchmarking was also done. FINDINGS: 66 936 patients who had undergone cardiac catheterisation at University Hospital Heidelberg were identified, with more than 183 772 individual left ventricular pressure measurements. We extracted 4390 patients from this initial group, of whom 1131 (25.8%) had been diagnosed with ischaemic cardiomyopathy, 1064 (24.2%) had been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, 816 (18.6%) had been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 202 (4.6%) had been diagnosed with amyloidosis, and 1177 (26.7%) were control individuals with no structural phenotype. The core cohort only included patients with cardiac catherisation and cMRI within 30 days, and emergency cases were excluded. AI-sex was able to predict patient sex with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.78 (95% CI 0.77-0.78) and AI-age was able to predict patient age with a mean absolute error of 7.86 years (7.77-7.95), with a Pearson correlation of 0.57 (95% CI 0.56-0.57). The AUCs for the classification tasks ranged between 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.84) for ischaemic cardiomyopathy and 0.92 (0.91-0.94) for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

38670456,No,Yes,No,No,Applying Artificial Intelligence for Phenotyping of Inherited Arrhythmia Syndromes.,"Inherited arrhythmia disorders account for a significant proportion of sudden cardiac death, particularly among young individuals. Recent advances in our understanding of these syndromes have improved patient diagnosis and care, yet certain clinical gaps remain, particularly within case ascertainment, access to genetic testing, and risk stratification. Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning and its subset deep learning, present promising solutions to these challenges. The capacity of AI to process vast amounts of patient data and identify disease patterns differentiates them from traditional methods, which are time- and resource-intensive. To date, AI models have shown immense potential in condition detection (including asymptomatic/concealed disease) and genotype and phenotype identification, exceeding expert cardiologists in these tasks. Additionally, they have exhibited applicability for general population screening, improving case ascertainment in a set of conditions that are often asymptomatic such as left ventricular dysfunction. Third, models have shown the ability to improve testing protocols; through model identification of disease and genotype, specific clinical testing (eg, drug challenges or further diagnostic imaging) can be avoided, reducing health care expenses, speeding diagnosis, and possibly allowing for more incremental or targeted genetic testing approaches. These significant benefits warrant continued investigation of AI, particularly regarding the development and implementation of clinically applicable screening tools. In this review we summarize key developments in AI, including studies in long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, and provide direction for effective future AI implementation in clinical practice."
38595869,No,Yes,No,No,Early Diagnosis of Cardiovascular Diseases in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: An In-Depth Review.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are significant health issues that result in high death rates globally. Early detection of cardiovascular events may lower the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction and reduce death rates in people with CVDs. Traditional data analysis is inadequate for managing multidimensional data related to the risk prediction of CVDs, heart attacks, medical image interpretations, therapeutic decision-making, and disease prognosis due to the complex pathological mechanisms and multiple factors involved. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that utilizes advanced computer algorithms to extract information from large databases, and it has been integrated into the medical industry. AI methods have shown the ability to speed up the advancement of diagnosing and treating CVDs such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, and more. In clinical settings, AI has shown usefulness in diagnosing cardiovascular illness, improving the efficiency of supporting tools, stratifying and categorizing diseases, and predicting outcomes. Advanced AI algorithms have been intricately designed to analyze intricate relationships within extensive healthcare data, enabling them to tackle more intricate jobs compared to conventional approaches."
38559021,No,Yes,No,No,Artificial intelligence-guided detection of under-recognized cardiomyopathies on point-of-care cardiac ultrasound: a multi-center study.,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) enables cardiac imaging at the bedside and in communities but is limited by abbreviated protocols and variation in quality. We developed and tested artificial intelligence (AI) models to automate the detection of underdiagnosed cardiomyopathies from cardiac POCUS. METHODS: In a development set of 290,245 transthoracic echocardiographic videos across the Yale-New Haven Health System (YNHHS), we used augmentation approaches and a customized loss function weighted for view quality to derive a POCUS-adapted, multi-label, video-based convolutional neural network (CNN) that discriminates HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and ATTR-CM (transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy) from controls without known disease. We evaluated the final model across independent, internal and external, retrospective cohorts of individuals who underwent cardiac POCUS across YNHHS and Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) emergency departments (EDs) (2011-2024) to prioritize key views and validate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of single-view screening protocols. FINDINGS: We identified 33,127 patients (median age 61 [IQR: 45-75] years, n=17,276 [52.2%] female) at YNHHS and 5,624 (57 [IQR: 39-71] years, n=1,953 [34.7%] female) at MSHS with 78,054 and 13,796 eligible cardiac POCUS videos, respectively. An AI-enabled single-view screening approach successfully discriminated HCM (AUROC of 0.90 [YNHHS] & 0.89 [MSHS]) and ATTR-CM (YNHHS: AUROC of 0.92 [YNHHS] & 0.99 [MSHS]). In YNHHS, 40 (58.0%) HCM and 23 (47.9%) ATTR-CM cases had a positive screen at median of 2.1 [IQR: 0.9-4.5] and 1.9 [IQR: 1.0-3.4] years before clinical diagnosis. Moreover, among 24,448 participants without known cardiomyopathy followed over 2.2 [IQR: 1.1-5.8] years, AI-POCUS probabilities in the highest (vs lowest) quintile for HCM and ATTR-CM conferred a 15% (adj.HR 1.15 [95%CI: 1.02-1.29]) and 39% (adj.HR 1.39 [95%CI: 1.22-1.59]) higher age- and sex-adjusted mortality risk, respectively. INTERPRETATION: We developed and validated an AI framework that enables scalable, opportunistic screening of treatable cardiomyopathies wherever POCUS is used.

38486361,No,Yes,No,No,Anderson-Fabry disease management: role of the cardiologist.,"Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by glycolipid accumulation in cardiac cells, associated with a peculiar form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Up to 1% of patients with a diagnosis of HCM indeed have AFD. With the availability of targeted therapies for sarcomeric HCM and its genocopies, a timely differential diagnosis is essential. Specifically, the therapeutic landscape for AFD is rapidly evolving and offers increasingly effective, disease-modifying treatment options. However, diagnosing AFD may be difficult, particularly in the non-classic phenotype with prominent or isolated cardiac involvement and no systemic red flags. For many AFD patients, the clinical journey from initial clinical manifestations to diagnosis and appropriate treatment remains challenging, due to late recognition or utter neglect. Consequently, late initiation of treatment results in an exacerbation of cardiac involvement, representing the main cause of morbidity and mortality, irrespective of gender. Optimal management of AFD patients requires a dedicated multidisciplinary team, in which the cardiologist plays a decisive role, ranging from the differential diagnosis to the prevention of complications and the evaluation of timing for disease-specific therapies. The present review aims to redefine the role of cardiologists across the main decision nodes in contemporary AFD clinical care and drug discovery."
38350900,No,Yes,No,No,Automated assessment of cardiac pathologies on cardiac MRI using T1-mapping and late gadolinium phase sensitive inversion recovery sequences with deep learning.,"BACKGROUND: A deep learning (DL) model that automatically detects cardiac pathologies on cardiac MRI may help streamline the diagnostic workflow. To develop a DL model to detect cardiac pathologies on cardiac MRI T1-mapping and late gadolinium phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) sequences were used. METHODS: Subjects in this study were either diagnosed with cardiac pathology (n = 137) including acute and chronic myocardial infarction, myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or classified as normal (n = 63). Cardiac MR imaging included T1-mapping and PSIR sequences. Subjects were split 65/15/20% for training, validation, and hold-out testing. The DL models were based on an ImageNet pretrained DenseNet-161 and implemented using PyTorch and fastai. Data augmentation with random rotation and mixup was applied. Categorical cross entropy was used as the loss function with a cyclic learning rate (1e-3). DL models for both sequences were developed separately using similar training parameters. The final model was chosen based on its performance on the validation set. Gradient-weighted class activation maps (Grad-CAMs) visualized the decision-making process of the DL model. RESULTS: The DL model achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100%, 38%, and 88% on PSIR images and 78%, 54%, and 70% on T1-mapping images. Grad-CAMs demonstrated that the DL model focused its attention on myocardium and cardiac pathology when evaluating MR images. CONCLUSIONS: The developed DL models were able to reliably detect cardiac pathologies on cardiac MR images. The diagnostic performance of T1 mapping alone is particularly of note since it does not require a contrast agent and can be acquired quickly."
37873442,No,Yes,No,No,Deriving Explainable Metrics of Left Ventricular Flow by Reduced-Order Modeling and Classification.,"BACKGROUND: Extracting explainable flow metrics is a bottleneck to the clinical translation of advanced cardiac flow imaging modalities. We hypothesized that reduced-order models (ROMs) of intraventricular flow are a suitable strategy for deriving simple and interpretable clinical metrics suitable for further assessments. Combined with machine learning (ML) flow-based ROMs could provide new insight to help diagnose and risk-stratify patients. METHODS: We analyzed 2D color-Doppler echocardiograms of 81 non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients, 51 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients, and 77 normal volunteers (Control). We applied proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to build patient-specific and cohort-specific ROMs of LV flow. Each ROM aggregates a low number of components representing a spatially dependent velocity map modulated along the cardiac cycle by a time-dependent coefficient. We tested three classifiers using deliberately simple ML analyses of these ROMs with varying supervision levels. In supervised models, hyperparameter gridsearch was used to derive the ROMs that maximize classification power. The classifiers were blinded to LV chamber geometry and function. We ran vector flow mapping on the color-Doppler sequences to help visualize flow patterns and interpret the ML results. RESULTS: POD-based ROMs stably represented each cohort through 10-fold cross-validation. The principal POD mode captured >80% of the flow kinetic energy (KE) in all cohorts and represented the LV filling/emptying jets. Mode 2 represented the diastolic vortex and its KE contribution ranged from <1% (HCM) to 13% (DCM). Semi-unsupervised classification using patient-specific ROMs revealed that the KE ratio of these two principal modes, the vortex-to-jet (V2J) energy ratio, is a simple, interpretable metric that discriminates DCM, HCM, and Control patients. Receiver operating characteristic curves using V2J as classifier had areas under the curve of 0.81, 0.91, and 0.95 for distinguishing HCM vs. Control, DCM vs. Control, and DCM vs. HCM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Modal decomposition of cardiac flow can be used to create ROMs of normal and pathological flow patterns, uncovering simple interpretable flow metrics with power to discriminate disease states, and particularly suitable for further processing using ML."
37697378,No,Yes,No,No,Molecular and phenotypic spectrum of cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome in Chinese patients.,"BACKGROUND: Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a RASopathy subtype that presents with unique craniofacial dysmorphology, congenital heart disease, dermatologic abnormalities, growth retardation, and intellectual disability. This study describes the phenotypic spectrum of CFC in China and its association with CFC syndrome gene variants. RESULTS: Twenty Chinese CFC patients, aged 0.6-9.5 years old, were included in this study and their clinical phenotypic spectrum was compared with that of 186 patients with CFC from non-Chinese ethnicities. All 20 Chinese patients with CFC carried de novo heterozygous BRAF, MAP2K1, and MAP2K2 variants. Two novel variants were detected and consistently predicted to be deleterious using bioinformatic tools. The clinical features of CFC in the Chinese patients included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (2/20, 10%), pulmonary valve stenosis (2/20, 10%), curly or sparse hair (7/20, 35%), epilepsy (1/20, 5%), and hypotonia (10/20, 50%); these features were less frequently observed in Chinese patients than non-Chinese patients (p < 0.05). In contrast, feeding difficulties (19/20, 95%) were more frequently observed in the Chinese patients. Absent eyebrows and severe short stature were more common in patients with BRAF variants than in those with MAP2K1/2 variants. Facial recognition software was used to recognize most CFC patients using artificial intelligence. CONCLUSION: This study identified novel and common variants in our cohort of 20 Chinese patients with CFC. We uncovered differences in clinical features between Chinese and non-Chinese patients and detected genotype-phenotype correlations among the BRAF and MAP2K1/2 variant subgroups. This is the largest cohort of Chinese CFC patients to our knowledge, providing new insights into a subtype of RASopathy."
37685592,No,Yes,No,No,"Quantification of Myocardial Contraction Fraction with Three-Dimensional Automated, Machine-Learning-Based Left-Heart-Chamber Metrics: Diagnostic Utility in Hypertrophic Phenotypes and Normal Ejection Fraction.","Aims: The differentiation of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophic phenotypes is challenging in patients with normal ejection fraction (EF). The myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) is a simple dimensionless index useful for specifically identifying cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) when calculated by cardiac magnetic resonance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of MCF measured by three-dimensional automated, machine-learning-based LV chamber metrics (dynamic heart model [DHM]) for the discrimination of different forms of hypertrophic phenotypes. Methods and Results: We analyzed the DHM LV metrics of patients with CA (n = 10), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, n = 36), isolated hypertension (IH, n = 87), and 54 healthy controls. MCF was calculated by dividing LV stroke volume by LV myocardial volume. Compared with controls (median 61.95%, interquartile range 55.43-67.79%), mean values for MCF were significantly reduced in HCM-48.55% (43.46-54.86% p < 0.001)-and CA-40.92% (36.68-46.84% p < 0.002)-but not in IH-59.35% (53.22-64.93% p < 0.7). MCF showed a weak correlation with EF in the overall cohort (R(2) = 0.136) and the four study subgroups (healthy adults, R(2) = 0.039 IH, R(2) = 0.089; HCM, R(2) = 0.225; CA, R(2) = 0.102). ROC analyses showed that MCF could differentiate between healthy adults and HCM (sensitivity 75.9%, specificity 77.8%, AUC 0.814) and between healthy adults and CA (sensitivity 87.0%, specificity 100%, AUC 0.959). The best cut-off values were 55.3% and 52.8%. Conclusions: The easily derived quantification of MCF by DHM can refine our echocardiographic discrimination capacity in patients with hypertrophic phenotype and normal EF. It should be added to the diagnostic workup of these patients."
37498303,No,Yes,No,No,Identification of TGF-beta-related genes in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure based on single cell RNA sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) remains a huge medical burden worldwide. Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is one of the most significant phenotypes of HF. Several studies have reported that the TGF-beta pathway plays a double-sided role in HF. Therefore, TGF-beta-related genes (TRGs) may be potential therapeutic targets for cardiac hypertrophy and HF. However, the roles of TRGs in HF at the single-cell level remain unclear. METHOD: In this study, to analyze the expression pattern of TRGs during the progress of cardiac hypertrophy and HF, we used three public single-cell RNA sequencing datasets for HF (GSE161470, GSE145154, and GSE161153), one HF transcriptome data (GSE57338), and one hypertrophic cardiomyopathy transcriptome data (GSE141910). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), functional enrichment analysis and machine learning algorithms were used to filter hub genes. Transverse aortic constriction mice model, CCK-8, wound healing assay, quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were used to validate bioinformatics results. RESULTS: We observed that cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and endothelial cells showed high TGF-beta activity during the progress of HF. Three modules (royalblue, brown4, and darkturquoize) were identified to be significantly associated with TRGs in HF. Six hub genes (TANC2, ADAMTS2, DYNLL1, MRC2, EGR1, and OTUD1) showed anomaly trend in cardiac hypertrophy. We further validated the regulation of the TGF-beta-MYC-ADAMTS2 axis on CFs activation in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified six hub genes (TANC2, ADAMTS2, DYNLL1, MRC2, EGR1, and OTUD1) by integrating scRNA and transcriptome data. These six hub genes might be therapeutic targets for cardiac hypertrophy and HF."

AI techniques have shown the potential to accelerate the progression of diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease and so on. In clinical scenario, AI have been proved to apply well in CVD diagnosis, enhance effectiveness of auxiliary tools, disease stratification and typing, and outcome prediction. Deeply developed to capture subtle connections from massive amounts of healthcare data, recent AI algorithms are expected to handle even more complex tasks than traditional methods. The aim of this review is to introduce current applications of AI in CVDs, which may allow clinicians who have limited expertise of computer science to better understand the frontier of the subject and put AI algorithms into clinical practice."
37171710,No,Yes,No,No,A systematic literature review of economic evaluations and cost-of-illness studies of inherited cardiomyopathies.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are commonly inherited heart conditions associated with a high risk of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. To understand the economic and societal disease burden, this study systematically identified and reviewed cost-of-illness (COI) studies and economic evaluations (EEs) of various interventions for HCM and DCM. A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS EED, EconLit and Web of Science to identify COI studies and EEs published between 1 January 2010 and 28 April 2021. The selection of studies and their critical appraisal were performed jointly by two independent researchers. For the quality assessment, the 'Consensus on Health Economic Criteria' list was used. Two COI studies and 11 EEs were eligible for inclusion. Cost-effectiveness varied among interventions and depended on the targeted patient population. Both COI studies identified only hospitalisation costs in HCM. The mean study quality was high in EEs but low in COI studies. Most studies excluded costs for patients, caregivers and productivity losses. Overall, knowledge of the societal and economic burden of inherited cardiomyopathies is limited. Future research needs to include quality-adjusted life years and a broader range of costs to provide an information base for optimising care for affected patients."
37093501,No,Yes,No,No,Multi-channel deep learning model-based myocardial spatial-temporal morphology feature on cardiac MRI cine images diagnoses the cause of LVH.,"BACKGROUND: To develop a fully automatic framework for the diagnosis of cause for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) via cardiac cine images. METHODS: A total of 302 LVH patients with cine MRI images were recruited as the primary cohort. Another 53 LVH patients prospectively collected or from multi-centers were used as the external test dataset. Different models based on the cardiac regions (Model 1), segmented ventricle (Model 2) and ventricle mask (Model 3) were constructed. The diagnostic performance was accessed by the confusion matrix with respect to overall accuracy. The capability of the predictive models for binary classification of cardiac amyloidosis (CA), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or hypertensive heart disease (HHD) were also evaluated. Additionally, the diagnostic performance of best Model was compared with that of 7 radiologists/cardiologists. RESULTS: Model 3 showed the best performance with an overall classification accuracy up to 77.4% in the external test datasets. On the subtasks for identifying CA, HCM or HHD only, Model 3 also achieved the best performance with AUCs yielding 0.895-0.980, 0.879-0.984 and 0.848-0.983 in the validation, internal test and external test datasets, respectively. The deep learning model showed non-inferior diagnostic capability to the cardiovascular imaging expert and outperformed other radiologists/cardiologists. CONCLUSION: The combined model based on the mask of left ventricular segmented from multi-sequences cine MR images shows favorable and robust performance in diagnosing the cause of left ventricular hypertrophy, which could be served as a noninvasive tool and help clinical decision."
37028009,No,Yes,No,No,Segmentation of Pericardial Adipose Tissue in CMR Images: A Benchmark Dataset MRPEAT and a Triple-Stage Network 3SUnet.,"Increased pericardial adipose tissue (PEAT) is associated with a series of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and metabolic syndromes. Quantitative analysis of PEAT by means of image segmentation is of great significance. Although cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has been utilized as a routine method for non-invasive and non-radioactive CVD diagnosis, segmentation of PEAT in CMR images is challenging and laborious. In practice, no public CMR datasets are available for validating PEAT automatic segmentation. Therefore, we first release a benchmark CMR dataset, MRPEAT, which consists of cardiac short axis (SA) CMR images from 50 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 50 acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and 50 normal control (NC) subjects. We then propose a deep learning model, named as 3SUnet, to segment PEAT on MRPEAT to tackle the challenges that PEAT is relatively small and diverse and its intensities are hard to distinguish from the background. The 3SUnet is a triple-stage network, of which the backbones are all Unet. One Unet is used to extract a region of interest (ROI) for any given image with ventricles and PEAT being contained completely using a multi-task continual learning strategy. Another Unet is adopted to segment PEAT in ROI-cropped images. The third Unet is utilized to refine PEAT segmentation accuracy guided by an image adaptive probability map. The proposed model is qualitatively and quantitatively compared with the state-of-the-art models on the dataset. We obtain the PEAT segmentation results through 3SUnet, assess the robustness of 3SUnet under different pathological conditions, and identify the imaging indications of PEAT in CVDs. The dataset and all source codes are available at https://dflag-neu.github.io/member/csz/research/."
36944631,No,Yes,No,No,Clinical and genetic associations of deep learning-derived cardiac magnetic resonance-based left ventricular mass.,"Left ventricular mass is a risk marker for cardiovascular events, and may indicate an underlying cardiomyopathy. Cardiac magnetic resonance is the gold-standard for left ventricular mass estimation, but is challenging to obtain at scale. Here, we use deep learning to enable genome-wide association study of cardiac magnetic resonance-derived left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area within 43,230 UK Biobank participants. We identify 12 genome-wide associations (1 known at TTN and 11 novel for left ventricular mass), implicating genes previously associated with cardiac contractility and cardiomyopathy. Cardiac magnetic resonance-derived indexed left ventricular mass is associated with incident dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implant. An indexed left ventricular mass polygenic risk score >/=90(th) percentile is also associated with incident implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implant in separate UK Biobank (hazard ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.44) and Mass General Brigham (hazard ratio 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.74) samples. Here, we perform a genome-wide association study of cardiac magnetic resonance-derived indexed left ventricular mass to identify 11 novel variants and demonstrate that cardiac magnetic resonance-derived and genetically predicted indexed left ventricular mass are associated with incident cardiomyopathy."
36827870,No,Yes,No,No,Automatic uncertainty-based quality controlled T1 mapping and ECV analysis from native and post-contrast cardiac T1 mapping images using Bayesian vision transformer.,"Deep learning-based methods for cardiac MR segmentation have achieved state-of-the-art results. However, these methods can generate incorrect segmentation results which can lead to wrong clinical decisions in the downstream tasks. Automatic and accurate analysis of downstream tasks, such as myocardial tissue characterization, is highly dependent on the quality of the segmentation results. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to use quality control methods to detect the failed segmentations before further analysis. In this work, we propose a fully automatic uncertainty-based quality control framework for T1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) analysis. The framework consists of three parts. The first one focuses on segmentation of cardiac structures from a native and post-contrast T1 mapping dataset (n=295) using a Bayesian Swin transformer-based U-Net. In the second part, we propose a novel uncertainty-based quality control (QC) to detect inaccurate segmentation results. The QC method utilizes image-level uncertainty features as input to a random forest-based classifier/regressor to determine the quality of the segmentation outputs. The experimental results from four different types of segmentation results show that the proposed QC method achieves a mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.927 on binary classification and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.021 on Dice score regression, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art uncertainty based QC methods. The performance gap is notably higher in predicting the segmentation quality from poor-performing models which shows the robustness of our method in detecting failed segmentations. After the inaccurate segmentation results are detected and rejected by the QC method, in the third part, T1 mapping and ECV values are computed automatically to characterize the myocardial tissues of healthy and cardiac pathological cases. The native myocardial T1 and ECV values computed from automatic and manual segmentations show an excellent agreement yielding Pearson coefficients of 0.990 and 0.975 (on the combined validation and test sets), respectively. From the results, we observe that the automatically computed myocardial T1 and ECV values have the ability to characterize myocardial tissues of healthy and cardiac diseases like myocardial infarction, amyloidosis, Tako-Tsubo syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
36826967,No,Yes,No,No,"Developing an Echocardiography-Based, Automatic Deep Learning Framework for the Differentiation of Increased Left Ventricular Wall Thickness Etiologies.","AIMS: Increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness is frequently encountered in transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). While accurate and early diagnosis is clinically important, given the differences in available therapeutic options and prognosis, an extensive workup is often required to establish the diagnosis. We propose the first echo-based, automated deep learning model with a fusion architecture to facilitate the evaluation and diagnosis of increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with an established diagnosis of increased LV wall thickness (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), cardiac amyloidosis (CA), and hypertensive heart disease (HTN)/others) between 1/2015 and 11/2019 at Mayo Clinic Arizona were identified. The cohort was divided into 80%/10%/10% for training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. Six baseline TTE views were used to optimize a pre-trained InceptionResnetV2 model. Each model output was used to train a meta-learner under a fusion architecture. Model performance was assessed by multiclass area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). A total of 586 patients were used for the final analysis (194 HCM, 201 CA, and 191 HTN/others). The mean age was 55.0 years, and 57.8% were male. Among the individual view-dependent models, the apical 4-chamber model had the best performance (AUROC: HCM: 0.94, CA: 0.73, and HTN/other: 0.87). The final fusion model outperformed all the view-dependent models (AUROC: HCM: 0.93, CA: 0.90, and HTN/other: 0.92). CONCLUSION: The echo-based InceptionResnetV2 fusion model can accurately classify the main etiologies of increased LV wall thickness and can facilitate the process of diagnosis and workup."
36775820,No,Yes,No,No,Reverse remodeling of left atrium assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy after septal myectomy.,"BACKGROUND: Assessing the structure and function of left atrium (LA) is crucial in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) because LA remodeling correlates with atrial fibrillation. However, few studies have investigated the potential effect of myomectomy on LA phasic remodeling in HOCM after myectomy using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) feature tracking (FT). This study aims to evaluate the LA structural and functional remodeling with HOCM after myectomy by CMR-FT and to further investigate the determinants of LA reverse remodeling. METHODS: In this single-center study, we retrospectively studied 88 patients with HOCM who received CMR before and after myectomy between January 2011 and June 2021. Preoperative and postoperative LA parameters derived from CMR-FT were compared, including LA reservoir function (total ejection fraction [EF], total strain [epsilons], peak positive strain rate [SRs]), conduit function (passive EF, passive strain [epsilone], peak early negative strain rate [SRe]) and booster function (booster EF, active strain [epsilona], late peak negative strain rate [SRa]). Eighty-six healthy participants were collected for comparison. Univariate and multivariate linear regression identified variables associated with the rate of change of epsilona. RESULTS: Compared with preoperative parameters, LA reservoir function (total EF, epsilons, SRs), booster function (booster EF, epsilona, SRa), and SRe were significantly improved after myectomy (all P < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in passive EF and epsilone. Postoperative patients with HOCM still had larger LA and worse LA function than healthy controls (all P < 0.05). After analyzing the rates of change in LA parameters, LA boost function, especially epsilona, showed the most dramatic improvement beyond the improvements in reservoir function, conduit function, and volume. In multivariable regression analysis, minimum LA volume index (adjusted beta = - 0.39, P < 0.001) and Deltaleft ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) pressure gradient (adjusted beta = - 0.29, P = 0.003) were significantly related to the rate of change of epsilona. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HOCM after septal myectomy showed LA reverse remodeling with a reduction in LA size and restoration in LA reservoir and booster function but unchanged LA conduit function. Among volumetric and functional changes, booster function had the greatest improvement postoperatively. Besides, preoperative LAV(min) index and DeltaLVOT might be potential factors associated with the degree of improvement in epsilona."
36763207,No,Yes,No,No,Deep learn-based computer-assisted transthoracic echocardiography: approach to the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis.,"Myocardial amyloidosis (CA) differs from other etiological pathologies of left ventricular hypertrophy in that transthoracic echocardiography is challenging to assess the texture features based on human visual observation. There are few studies on myocardial texture based on echocardiography. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive machine learning method based on ultrasonic image texture features to identify CA. In this retrospective study, a total of 289 participants (50 cases of myocardial amyloidosis; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: 70 cases; Uremic cardiomyopathy: 92 cases; Hypertensive heart disease: 77 cases). We extracted the myocardial ultrasonic imaging features of these patients and screened the features, and four models of random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR) and gradient decision-making lifting tree (GBDT) were established to distinguish myocardial amyloidosis from other diseases. Finally, the diagnostic efficiency of the model was evaluated and compared with the traditional ultrasonic diagnostic methods. In the overall population, the four machine learning models we established could effectively distinguish CA from nonCA diseases, AUC (RF 0.77, SVM 0.81, LR 0.81, GBDT 0.71). The LR model had the best diagnostic efficiency with recall, F1-score, sensitivity and specificity of 0.21, 0.34, 0.21 and 1.0, respectively. Slightly better than the traditional ultrasonic diagnosis model. In further subgroup analysis, the myocardial amyloidosis group was compared one-by-one with the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, uremic cardiomyopathy, and hypertensive heart disease groups, and the same method was used for feature extraction and data modeling. The diagnostic efficiency of the model was further improved. Notably, in identifying of the CA group and HHD group, AUC values reached more than 0.92, accuracy reached more than 0.87, sensitivity equal to or greater than 0.81, specificity 0.91, and F1 score higher than 0.84. This novel method based on echocardiography combined with machine learning may have the potential to be used in the diagnosis of CA."
36593284,No,Yes,No,No,"A deep learning framework assisted echocardiography with diagnosis, lesion localization, phenogrouping heterogeneous disease, and anomaly detection.","Echocardiography is the first-line diagnostic technique for heart diseases. Although artificial intelligence techniques have made great improvements in the analysis of echocardiography, the major limitations remain to be the built neural networks are normally adapted to a few diseases and specific equipment. Here, we present an end-to-end deep learning framework named AIEchoDx that differentiates four common cardiovascular diseases (Atrial Septal Defect, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, prior Myocardial Infarction) from normal subjects with performance comparable to that of consensus of three senior cardiologists in AUCs (99.50% vs 99.26%, 98.75% vs 92.75%, 99.57% vs 97.21%, 98.52% vs 84.20%, and 98.70% vs 89.41%), respectively. Meanwhile, AIEchoDx accurately recognizes critical lesion regions of interest along with each disease by visualizing the decision-making process. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that heterogeneous diseases, like dilated cardiomyopathy, could be classified into two phenogroups with distinct clinical characteristics. Finally, AIEchoDx performs efficiently as an anomaly detection tool when applying handheld device-produced videos. Together, AIEchoDx provides a potential diagnostic assistant tool in either cart-based echocardiography equipment or handheld echocardiography device for primary and point-of-care medical personnel with high diagnostic performance, and the application of lesion region identification and heterogeneous disease phenogrouping, which may broaden the application of artificial intelligence in echocardiography."
38357567,No,Yes,No,No,Artificial intelligence in cardiovascular medicine: An updated review of the literature.,"Screening and early detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are crucial for managing progress and preventing related morbidity. In recent years, several studies have reported the important role of Artificial intelligence (AI) technology and its integration into various medical sectors. AI applications are able to deal with the massive amounts of data (medical records, ultrasounds, medications, and experimental results) generated in medicine and identify novel details that would otherwise be forgotten in the mass of healthcare data sets. Nowadays, AI algorithms are currently used to improve diagnosis of some CVDs including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension. This review summarized some AI concepts, critical execution requirements, obstacles, and new applications for CVDs."
36470931,No,Yes,No,No,Differential diagnosis of common etiologies of left ventricular hypertrophy using a hybrid CNN-LSTM model.,"Differential diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is often obscure on echocardiography and requires numerous additional tests. We aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm to aid in the differentiation of common etiologies of LVH (i.e. hypertensive heart disease [HHD], hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [HCM], and light-chain cardiac amyloidosis [ALCA]) on echocardiographic images. Echocardiograms in 5 standard views (parasternal long-axis, parasternal short-axis, apical 4-chamber, apical 2-chamber, and apical 3-chamber) were obtained from 930 subjects: 112 with HHD, 191 with HCM, 81 with ALCA and 546 normal subjects. The study population was divided into training (n = 620), validation (n = 155), and test sets (n = 155). A convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) algorithm was constructed to independently classify the 3 diagnoses on each view, and the final diagnosis was made by an aggregate network based on the simultaneously predicted probabilities of HCM, HCM, and ALCA. Diagnostic performance of the algorithm was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and accuracy was evaluated by the confusion matrix. The deep learning algorithm was trained and verified using the training and validation sets, respectively. In the test set, the average AUC across the five standard views was 0.962, 0.982 and 0.996 for HHD, HCM and CA, respectively. The overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher for the deep learning algorithm (92.3%) than for echocardiography specialists (80.0% and 80.6%). In the present study, we developed a deep learning algorithm for the differential diagnosis of 3 common LVH etiologies (HHD, HCM and ALCA) by applying a hybrid CNN-LSTM model and aggregate network to standard echocardiographic images. The high diagnostic performance of our deep learning algorithm suggests that the use of deep learning can improve the diagnostic process in patients with LVH."
36447413,No,Yes,No,No,Automated Measurement of Native T1 and Extracellular Volume Fraction in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using a Commercially Available Deep Learning Algorithm.,"OBJECTIVE: T1 mapping provides valuable information regarding cardiomyopathies. Manual drawing is time consuming and prone to subjective errors. Therefore, this study aimed to test a DL algorithm for the automated measurement of native T1 and extracellular volume (ECV) fractions in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with a temporally separated dataset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CMR images obtained for 95 participants (mean age +/- standard deviation, 54.5 +/- 15.2 years), including 36 left ventricular hypertrophy (12 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 12 Fabry disease, and 12 amyloidosis), 32 dilated cardiomyopathy, and 27 healthy volunteers, were included. A commercial deep learning (DL) algorithm based on 2D U-net (Myomics-T1 software, version 1.0.0) was used for the automated analysis of T1 maps. Four radiologists, as study readers, performed manual analysis. The reference standard was the consensus result of the manual analysis by two additional expert readers. The segmentation performance of the DL algorithm and the correlation and agreement between the automated measurement and the reference standard were assessed. Interobserver agreement among the four radiologists was analyzed. RESULTS: DL successfully segmented the myocardium in 99.3% of slices in the native T1 map and 89.8% of slices in the post-T1 map with Dice similarity coefficients of 0.86 +/- 0.05 and 0.74 +/- 0.17, respectively. Native T1 and ECV showed strong correlation and agreement between DL and the reference: for T1, r = 0.967 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.951-0.978) and bias of 9.5 msec (95% limits of agreement [LOA], -23.6-42.6 msec); for ECV, r = 0.987 (95% CI, 0.980-0.991) and bias of 0.7% (95% LOA, -2.8%-4.2%) on per-subject basis. Agreements between DL and each of the four radiologists were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] of 0.98-0.99 for both native T1 and ECV), comparable to the pairwise agreement between the radiologists (ICC of 0.97-1.00 and 0.99-1.00 for native T1 and ECV, respectively). CONCLUSION: The DL algorithm allowed automated T1 and ECV measurements comparable to those of radiologists."
36434343,No,Yes,No,No,Performance of artificial intelligence for biventricular cardiovascular magnetic resonance volumetric analysis in the clinical setting.,"Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) derived ventricular volumes and function guide clinical decision-making for various cardiac pathologies. We aimed to evaluate the efficiency and clinical applicability of a commercially available artificial intelligence (AI) method for performing biventricular volumetric analysis. Three-hundred CMR studies (100 with normal CMR findings, 50 dilated cardiomyopathy, 50 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 50 ischaemic heart disease and 50 congenital or valvular heart disease) were randomly selected from database. Manual biventricular volumetric analysis (CMRtools) results were derived from clinical reports and automated volumetric analyses were performed using short axis volumetry AI function of CircleCVI(42) v5.12 software. For 20 studies, a combined method of manually adjusted AI contours was tested and all three methods were timed. Clinicians; confidence in AI method was assessed using an online survey. Although agreement was better for left ventricle than right ventricle, AI analysis results were comparable to manual method. Manual adjustment of AI contours further improved agreement: within subject coefficient of variation decreased from 5.0% to 4.5% for left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and from 9.9% to 7.1% for right ventricular EF. Twenty manual analyses were performed in 250 min 12 s whereas same task took 5 min 48 s using AI method. Clinicians were open to adopt AI but concerns about accuracy and validity were raised. The AI method provides clinically valid outcomes and saves significant time. To address concerns raised by survey participants and overcome shortcomings of the automated myocardial segmentation, visual assessment of contours and performing manual corrections where necessary appears to be a practical approach."
36378251,No,Yes,No,No,Cardiac magnetic resonance radiomics for disease classification.,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the discriminability of quantitative radiomics features extracted from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and healthy (NOR) patients. METHODS: The data of two hundred and eighty-three patients with HCM (n = 48) or DCM (n = 52) and NOR (n = 123) were extracted from two publicly available datasets. Ten feature selection methods were first performed on twenty-one different sets of radiomics features extracted from the left ventricle, right ventricle, and myocardium segmented from CMR images in the end-diastolic frame, end-systolic frame, and a combination of both; then, nine classical machine learning methods were trained with the selected radiomics features to distinguish HCM, DCM, and NOR. Ninety classification models were constructed based on combinations of the ten feature selection methods and nine classifiers. The classification models were evaluated, and the optimal model was selected. The diagnostic performance of the selected model was also compared to that of state-of-the-art methods. RESULTS: The random forest minimum redundancy maximum relevance model with features based on LeastAxisLength, Maximum2DDiameterSlice, Median, MinorAxisLength, Sphericity, VoxelVolume, Kurtosis, Flatness, and Skewness was the highest performing model, achieving 91.2% classification accuracy. The cross-validated areas under the curve on the test dataset were 0.938, 0.966, and 0.936 for NOR, DCM, and HCM, respectively. Furthermore, compared with those of the state-of-the-art methods, the sensitivity and accuracy of this model were greatly improved. CONCLUSIONS: A predictive model was proposed based on CMR radiomics features for classifying HCM, DCM, and NOR patients. The model had good discriminability. KEY POINTS: * The first-order features and the features extracted from the LOG-filtered images have potential in distinguishing HCM patients from DCM patients. * The features extracted from the RV play little role in distinguishing DCM from HCM. * The VoxelVolume of the myocardium in the ED frame is important in the recognition of DCM."
36359536,No,Yes,No,No,A Machine Learning Challenge: Detection of Cardiac Amyloidosis Based on Bi-Atrial and Right Ventricular Strain and Cardiac Function.,"BACKGROUND: This study challenges state-of-the-art cardiac amyloidosis (CA) diagnostics by feeding multi-chamber strain and cardiac function into supervised machine (SVM) learning algorithms. METHODS: Forty-three CA (32 males; 79 years (IQR 71; 85)), 20 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, 10 males; 63.9 years (+/-7.4)) and 44 healthy controls (CTRL, 23 males; 56.3 years (IQR 52.5; 62.9)) received cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Left atrial, right atrial and right ventricular strain parameters and cardiac function generated a 41-feature matrix for decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), SVM linear and SVM radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm processing. A 10-feature principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using SVM linear and RBF. RESULTS: Forty-one features resulted in diagnostic accuracies of 87.9% (AUC = 0.960) for SVM linear, 90.9% (0.996; Precision = 94%; Sensitivity = 100%; F1-Score = 97%) using RBF kernel, 84.9% (0.970) for KNN, and 78.8% (0.787) for DT. The 10-feature PCA achieved 78.9% (0.962) via linear SVM and 81.8% (0.996) via RBF SVM. Explained variance presented bi-atrial longitudinal strain and left and right atrial ejection fraction as valuable CA predictors. CONCLUSION: SVM RBF kernel achieved competitive diagnostic accuracies under supervised conditions. Machine learning of multi-chamber cardiac strain and function may offer novel perspectives for non-contrast clinical decision-support systems in CA diagnostics."
36299807,No,Yes,No,No,Predictors of Adherence to Stroke Prevention in the BALKAN-AF Study: A Machine-Learning Approach.,"Background  Compared with usual care, guideline-adherent stroke prevention strategy, based on the ABC (Atrial fibrillation Better Care) pathway, is associated with better outcomes. Given that stroke prevention is central to atrial fibrillation (AF) management, improved efforts to determining predictors of adherence with 'A' (avoid stroke) component of the ABC pathway are needed. Purpose  We tested the hypothesis that more sophisticated methodology using machine learning (ML) algorithms could do this. Methods  In this post-hoc analysis of the BALKAN-AF dataset, ML algorithms and logistic regression were tested. The feature selection process identified a subset of variables that were most relevant for creating the model. Adherence with the 'A' criterion of the ABC pathway was defined as the use of oral anticoagulants (OAC) in patients with AF with a CHA (2) DS (2) -VASc score of 0 (male) or 1 (female). Results  Among 2,712 enrolled patients, complete data on 'A'-adherent management were available in 2,671 individuals (mean age 66.0 +/- 12.8; 44.5% female). Based on ML algorithms, independent predictors of 'A-criterion adherent management' were paroxysmal AF, center in capital city, and first-diagnosed AF. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease with chronic dialysis, and sleep apnea were independently associated with a lower likelihood of 'A'-criterion adherent management. ML evaluated predictors of adherence with the 'A' criterion of the ABC pathway derived an area under the receiver-operator curve of 0.710 (95%CI 0.67-0.75) for random forest with fine tuning. Conclusions  Machine learning identified paroxysmal AF, treatment center in the capital city, and first-diagnosed AF as predictors of adherence to the A pathway; and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease with chronic dialysis, and sleep apnea as predictors of non adherence."
36257197,No,Yes,No,No,Intelligent diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy using transthoracic echocardiography videos.,"PURPOSE: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality. Pathological LVH can be caused by various diseases. In this study, we explored the possibility of using time and frequency domain analysis of myocardial radiomics features for patients with LVH in differentiating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and uremic cardiomyopathy (UCM) based on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). This was the first study to explore TTE myocardial time and frequency domain analyses for multiple LVH etiology differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We proposed an artificially intelligent diagnosis system based on radiomics techniques for differentiating HCM, HHD and UCM on TTE videos of the apical four-chamber view, which mainly included interventricular septum (IVS) segmentation, feature extraction and classification. We used two independent cohorts, one with 150 patients, including 50 HHD, 50 HCM and 50 UCM, for segmentation training and testing, and another with 149 patients (namely the main cohort), including 50 HHD, 46 HCM and 53 UCM, for classification training and testing after segmentation and feature extraction. Firstly, the U-Net, Residual U-Net (ResUNet) and nnU-Net were trained and tested to segment the IVS on TTE still images in the first cohort. Then the trained model with the best segmentation performance was further used for IVS prediction of ordered TTE images in video sequences in the main cohort. The post-processing was used to eliminate the noisy debris by selecting the maximum connected region and smoothing the edges of the predicted IVS region. Secondly, static radiomics features were extracted from the IVS of ordered TTE images in each video sequence, and subsequently the time and frequency domain features were further extracted from each time series of a static radiomics feature in the video sequence. Finally, the point-wise gated Boltzmann machine (PGBM) was used to learn and fuse the time and frequency domain features, and the support vector machine was used to classify the learned features for LVH diagnosis. The classification was performed with five-fold cross validation. RESULTS: The ResUNet showed the best segmentation performance, with Dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.817, 76.3%, 99.6% and 98.6%, respectively. With post-processing, the Dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the ResUNet were further improved to 0.839, 77.0%, 99.8%, and 98.8%, respectively. The classification areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were 0.838 +/- 0.049 for HHD vs. HCM, 0.868 +/- 0.042 for HCM vs. UCM and 0.701 +/- 0.140 for HHD vs. UCM. CONCLUSION: In this work, we proposed an intelligent identification system for LVH etiology classification based on routine TTE video images with good diagnostic performance. This deep learning method is feasible in automatic TTE images interpretation and expected to assist clinicians in detecting the primary cause of LVH."
39076629,No,Yes,No,No,Echocardiography in the Diagnosis of Cardiomyopathies: Current Status and Future Directions.,"Cardiomyopathies are a challenging pathology and echocardiography is essential for diagnosis and prognosis. The most frequent cardiomyopathies are the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), followed by the less frequent restrictive (RCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricle cardiomyopathies (ARVC). Echocardiography can identify diagnostic features, and guide further testing for a definitive diagnosis. Echographic parameters are involved in risk score computing and prognosis assessment. While the most prevalent hallmark of HCM is the asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve with the obstructive phenotype, DCM shows dilated left ventricle with different degrees of systolic dysfunction, and RCM is usually characterized by undilated ventricles associated with atrial enlargement. The aim of this review is to display and compare the most frequent cardiomyopathies encountered in clinical practice and highlight their most characteristic features in a useful way for the practicing clinician."
35869125,No,Yes,No,No,Minimising multi-centre radiomics variability through image normalisation: a pilot study.,"Radiomics is an emerging technique for the quantification of imaging data that has recently shown great promise for deeper phenotyping of cardiovascular disease. Thus far, the technique has been mostly applied in single-centre studies. However, one of the main difficulties in multi-centre imaging studies is the inherent variability of image characteristics due to centre differences. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of radiomics variability under several image- and feature-based normalisation techniques was conducted using a multi-centre cardiovascular magnetic resonance dataset. 218 subjects divided into healthy (n = 112) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 106, HCM) groups from five different centres were considered. First and second order texture radiomic features were extracted from three regions of interest, namely the left and right ventricular cavities and the left ventricular myocardium. Two methods were used to assess features' variability. First, feature distributions were compared across centres to obtain a distribution similarity index. Second, two classification tasks were proposed to assess: (1) the amount of centre-related information encoded in normalised features (centre identification) and (2) the generalisation ability for a classification model when trained on these features (healthy versus HCM classification). The results showed that the feature-based harmonisation technique ComBat is able to remove the variability introduced by centre information from radiomic features, at the expense of slightly degrading classification performance. Piecewise linear histogram matching normalisation gave features with greater generalisation ability for classification ( balanced accuracy in between 0.78 +/- 0.08 and 0.79 +/- 0.09). Models trained with features from images without normalisation showed the worst performance overall ( balanced accuracy in between 0.45 +/- 0.28 and 0.60 +/- 0.22). In conclusion, centre-related information removal did not imply good generalisation ability for classification."
39076905,No,Yes,No,No,Construction of Prediction Model for Atrial Fibrillation with Valvular Heart Disease Based on Machine Learning.,"BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a major precipitating factor of atrial fibrillation (AF) that contributes to decreased cardiac function, heart failure, and stroke. Stroke induced by VHD combined with atrial fibrillation (AF-VHD) is a much more serious condition in comparison to VHD alone. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism governing VHD progression and to provide candidate treatment targets for AF-VHD. METHODS: Four public mRNA microarray datasets were downloaded and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) screening was performed. Weighted gene correlation network analysis was carried out to detect key modules and explore their relationships and disease status. Candidate hub signature genes were then screened within the key module using machine learning methods. The receiver operating characteristic curve and nomogram model analysis were used to determine the potential clinical significance of the hub genes. Subsequently, target gene protein levels in independent human atrial tissue samples were detected using western blotting. Specific expression analysis of the hub genes in the tissue and cell samples was performed using single-cell sequencing analysis in the Human Protein Atlas tool. RESULTS: A total of 819 common DEGs in combined datasets were screened. Fourteen modules were identified using the cut tree dynamic function. The cyan and purple modules were considered the most clinically significant for AF-VHD. Then, 25 hub genes in the cyan and purple modules were selected for further analysis. The pathways related to dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and heart contraction were concentrated in the purple and cyan modules of the AF-VHD. Genes of importance (CSRP3, MCOLN3, SLC25A5, and FIBP) were then identified based on machine learning. Of these, CSRP3 had a potential clinical significance and was specifically expressed in the heart tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The identified genes may play critical roles in the pathophysiological process of AF-VHD, providing new insights into VHD development to AF and helping to determine potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for treating AF-VHD."
35703369,No,Yes,No,No,"Accelerated cardiac T1 mapping with recurrent networks and cyclic, model-based loss.","BACKGROUND: Using the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) as a biomarker, the myocardium can be quantitatively characterized using cardiac T1 mapping. The modified Look-Locker inversion (MOLLI) recovery sequences have become the standard clinical method for cardiac T1 mapping. However, the MOLLI sequences require an 11-heartbeat breath-hold that can be difficult for subjects, particularly during exercise or pharmacologically induced stress. Although shorter cardiac T1 mapping sequences have been proposed, these methods suffer from reduced precision. As such, there is an unmet need for accelerated cardiac T1 mapping. PURPOSE: To accelerate cardiac T1 mapping MOLLI sequences by using neural networks to estimate T1 maps using a reduced number of T1-weighted images and their corresponding inversion times. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 911 pre-contrast T1 mapping datasets from 202 subjects (128 males, 56 +/- 15 years; 74 females, 54 +/- 17 years) and 574 T1 mapping post-contrast datasets from 193 subjects (122 males, 57 +/- 15 years; 71 females, 54 +/- 17 years) were acquired using the MOLLI-5(3)3 sequence and the MOLLI-4(1)3(1)2 sequence, respectively. All acquisition protocols used similar scan parameters: TR =  2.2 ms , TE =  1.12 ms , and FA =  35 composite function , gadoteridol (ProHance, Bracco Diagnostics) dose   approximately  0.075 mmol/kg . A bidirectional multilayered long short-term memory (LSTM) network with fully connected output and cyclic model-based loss was used to estimate T1 maps from the first three T1-weighted images and their corresponding inversion times for pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping. The performance of the proposed architecture was compared to the three-parameter T1 recovery model using the same reduction of the number of T1-weighted images and inversion times. Reference T1 maps were generated from the scanner using the full MOLLI sequences and the three-parameter T1 recovery model. Correlation and Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate network performance in which each point represents averaged regions of interest in the myocardium corresponding to the standard American Heart Association 16-segment model. The precision of the network was examined using consecutively repeated scans. Stress and rest pre-contrast MOLLI studies as well as various disease test cases, including amyloidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and sarcoidosis were also examined. Paired t-tests were used to determine statistical significance with p < 0.05 . RESULTS: Our proposed network demonstrated similar T1 estimations to the standard MOLLI sequences (pre-contrast: 1260 +/- 94 ms vs. 1254 +/- 91 ms with p =  0.13 ; post-contrast: 484 +/- 92 ms vs. 493 +/- 91 ms with p =  0.07 ). The precision of standard MOLLI sequences was well preserved with the proposed network architecture ( 24 +/- 28 ms vs. 18 +/- 13 ms ). Network-generated T1 reactivities are similar to stress and rest pre-contrast MOLLI studies ( 5.1 +/- 4.0 % vs. 4.9 +/- 4.4 % with p =  0.84 ). Amyloidosis T1 maps generated using the proposed network are also similar to the reference T1 maps (pre-contrast: 1243 +/- 140 ms vs. 1231 +/- 137 ms with p =  0.60 ; post-contrast: 348 +/- 26 ms vs. 346 +/- 27 ms with p =  0.89 ). CONCLUSIONS: A bidirectional multilayered LSTM network with fully connected output and cyclic model-based loss was used to generate high-quality pre- and post-contrast T1 maps using the first three T1-weighted images and their corresponding inversion times. This work demonstrates that combining deep learning with cardiac T1 mapping can potentially accelerate standard MOLLI sequences from 11 to 3 heartbeats."
35621913,No,Yes,No,No,Deep Neural Network for Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Image Segmentation.,"The analysis and interpretation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images are often time-consuming. The automated segmentation of cardiac structures can reduce the time required for image analysis. Spatial similarities between different CMR image types were leveraged to jointly segment multiple sequences using a segmentation model termed a multi-image type UNet (MI-UNet). This model was developed from 72 exams (46% female, mean age 63 +/- 11 years) performed on patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The MI-UNet for steady-state free precession (SSFP) images achieved a superior Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.92 +/- 0.06 compared to 0.87 +/- 0.08 for a single-image type UNet (p < 0.001). The MI-UNet for late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images also had a superior DSC of 0.86 +/- 0.11 compared to 0.78 +/- 0.11 for a single-image type UNet (p = 0.001). The difference across image types was most evident for the left ventricular myocardium in SSFP images and for both the left ventricular cavity and the left ventricular myocardium in LGE images. For the right ventricle, there were no differences in DCS when comparing the MI-UNet with single-image type UNets. The joint segmentation of multiple image types increases segmentation accuracy for CMR images of the left ventricle compared to single-image models. In clinical practice, the MI-UNet model may expedite the analysis and interpretation of CMR images of multiple types."
35598329,No,Yes,No,No,DeepHisCoM: deep learning pathway analysis using hierarchical structural component models.,"Many statistical methods for pathway analysis have been used to identify pathways associated with the disease along with biological factors such as genes and proteins. However, most pathway analysis methods neglect the complex nonlinear relationship between biological factors and pathways. In this study, we propose a Deep-learning pathway analysis using Hierarchical structured CoMponent models (DeepHisCoM) that utilize deep learning to consider a nonlinear complex contribution of biological factors to pathways by constructing a multilayered model which accounts for hierarchical biological structure. Through simulation studies, DeepHisCoM was shown to have a higher power in the nonlinear pathway effect and comparable power for the linear pathway effect when compared to the conventional pathway methods. Application to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) omics datasets, including metabolomic, transcriptomic and metagenomic datasets, demonstrated that DeepHisCoM successfully identified three well-known pathways that are highly associated with HCC, such as lysine degradation, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. Application to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataset also showed that DeepHisCoM identified four pathways that are highly associated with the severity of COVID-19, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Codes are available at https://github.com/chanwoo-park-official/DeepHisCoM."
35581935,No,Yes,No,No,Phenotyping in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: A key to find effective treatment.,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an increasingly widespread medical condition, with excessive morbidity and mortality. Recently, for the first time in HFpEF, a reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization was shown with empagliflozin. The failure of previous clinical trials in HFpEF might have resulted from suboptimal patient selection and inclusion of patients without ""true"" or clinically significant HFpEF. Another important factor might be the heterogeneity of HFpEF, and thus there is a growing interest in HFpEF phenotyping. This phenotyping can be based on clinical presentation (e.g., subtypes with predominant atrial fibrillation, obesity, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), or noncardiac comorbidities), but also on HFpEF etiology. Specific therapies, such as tafamidis in transthyretin-related amyloidosis (ATTR) or mavacamten in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, have demonstrated their efficacy. However, pathomechanisms leading to the development of different phenotypes of HFpEF seem more complex and subtle. Machine learning and neural network models might help identify specific subgroups within the HFpEF population that either cluster patients with similar genetic, biochemical, echocardiographic or clinical characteristics, or respond similarly to a given treatment. Herein, we review different approaches to HFpEF phenotyping and present some distinct HFpEF subtypes."
35241683,No,Yes,No,No,Federated learning for multi-center imaging diagnostics: a simulation study in cardiovascular disease.,"Deep learning models can enable accurate and efficient disease diagnosis, but have thus far been hampered by the data scarcity present in the medical world. Automated diagnosis studies have been constrained by underpowered single-center datasets, and although some results have shown promise, their generalizability to other institutions remains questionable as the data heterogeneity between institutions is not taken into account. By allowing models to be trained in a distributed manner that preserves patients' privacy, federated learning promises to alleviate these issues, by enabling diligent multi-center studies. We present the first simulated federated learning study on the modality of cardiovascular magnetic resonance and use four centers derived from subsets of the M&M and ACDC datasets, focusing on the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We adapt a 3D-CNN network pretrained on action recognition and explore two different ways of incorporating shape prior information to the model, and four different data augmentation set-ups, systematically analyzing their impact on the different collaborative learning choices. We show that despite the small size of data (180 subjects derived from four centers), the privacy preserving federated learning achieves promising results that are competitive with traditional centralized learning. We further find that federatively trained models exhibit increased robustness and are more sensitive to domain shift effects."

OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of a deep learning workflow in quantifying ventricular hypertrophy and predicting the cause of increased LV wall thickness. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included physician-curated cohorts from the Stanford Amyloid Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) Advanced Heart Disease Clinic for cardiac amyloidosis and the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease and the CSMC Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Clinic for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2020. The deep learning algorithm was trained and tested on retrospectively obtained independent echocardiogram videos from Stanford Healthcare, CSMC, and the Unity Imaging Collaborative. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the accuracy of the deep learning algorithm in measuring left ventricular dimensions and identifying patients with increased LV wall thickness diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac amyloidosis. RESULTS: The study included 23 745 patients: 12 001 from Stanford Health Care (6509 [54.2%] female; mean [SD] age, 61.6 [17.4] years) and 1309 from CSMC (808 [61.7%] female; mean [SD] age, 62.8 [17.2] years) with parasternal long-axis videos and 8084 from Stanford Health Care (4201 [54.0%] female; mean [SD] age, 69.1 [16.8] years) and 2351 from CSMS (6509 [54.2%] female; mean [SD] age, 69.6 [14.7] years) with apical 4-chamber videos. The deep learning algorithm accurately measured intraventricular wall thickness (mean absolute error [MAE], 1.2 mm; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3 mm), LV diameter (MAE, 2.4 mm; 95% CI, 2.2-2.6 mm), and posterior wall thickness (MAE, 1.4 mm; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5 mm) and classified cardiac amyloidosis (area under the curve [AUC], 0.83) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AUC, 0.98) separately from other causes of LV hypertrophy. In external data sets from independent domestic and international health care systems, the deep learning algorithm accurately quantified ventricular parameters (domestic: R2, 0.96; international: R2, 0.90). For the domestic data set, the MAE was 1.7 mm (95% CI, 1.6-1.8 mm) for intraventricular septum thickness, 3.8 mm (95% CI, 3.5-4.0 mm) for LV internal dimension, and 1.8 mm (95% CI, 1.7-2.0 mm) for LV posterior wall thickness. For the international data set, the MAE was 1.7 mm (95% CI, 1.5-2.0 mm) for intraventricular septum thickness, 2.9 mm (95% CI, 2.4-3.3 mm) for LV internal dimension, and 2.3 mm (95% CI, 1.9-2.7 mm) for LV posterior wall thickness. The deep learning algorithm accurately detected cardiac amyloidosis (AUC, 0.79) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AUC, 0.89) in the domestic external validation site. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the deep learning model accurately identified subtle changes in LV wall geometric measurements and the causes of hypertrophy. Unlike with human experts, the deep learning workflow is fully automated, allowing for reproducible, precise measurements, and may provide a foundation for precision diagnosis of cardiac hypertrophy."
35146435,No,Yes,No,No,Automatic Diagnosis Labeling of Cardiovascular MRI by Using Semisupervised Natural Language Processing of Text Reports.,"PURPOSE: To assess whether the semisupervised natural language processing (NLP) of text from clinical radiology reports could provide useful automated diagnosis categorization for ground truth labeling to overcome manual labeling bottlenecks in the machine learning pipeline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 1503 text cardiac MRI reports from 2016 to 2019 were manually annotated for five diagnoses by clinicians: normal, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction (MI), and myocarditis. A semisupervised method that uses bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) pretrained on 1.14 million scientific publications was fine-tuned by using the manually extracted labels, with a report dataset split into groups of 801 for training, 302 for validation, and 400 for testing. The model's performance was compared with two traditional NLP models: a rule-based model and a support vector machine (SVM) model. The models' F1 scores and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to analyze performance. RESULTS: After 15 epochs, the F1 scores on the test set of 400 reports were as follows: normal, 84%; DCM, 79%; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 86%; MI, 91%; and myocarditis, 86%. The pooled F1 score and area under the receiver operating curve were 86% and 0.96, respectively. On the same test set, the BERT model had a higher performance than the rule-based model (F1 score, 42%) and SVM model (F1 score, 82%). Diagnosis categories classified by using the BERT model performed the labeling of 1000 MR images in 0.2 second. CONCLUSION: The developed model used labels extracted from radiology reports to provide automated diagnosis categorization of MR images with a high level of performance.Keywords: Semisupervised Learning, Diagnosis/Classification/Application Domain, Named Entity Recognition, MRI Supplemental material is available for this article.

34891859,No,Yes,No,No,Comparison of three U-Net family architectures for left ventricular myocardial wall automatic segmentation.,"Left ventricular (LV) segmentation is an important process which can provide quantitative clinical measurements such as volume, wall thickness and ejection fraction. The development of an automatic LV segmentation procedure is a challenging and complicated task mainly due to the variation of the heart shape from patient to patient, especially for those with pathological and physiological changes. In this study, we focus on the implementation, evaluation and comparison of three different Deep Learning architectures of the U-Net family: the custom 2-D U-Net, the ResU-Net++ and the DenseU-Net, in order to segment the LV myocardial wall. Our approach was applied to cardiac CT datasets specifically derived from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The results of the models demonstrated high performance in the segmentation process with minor losses. The model revealed a dice score for U-Net, Res-U-net++ and Dense U-Net, 0.81, 0.82 and 0.84, respectively."
34861618,No,Yes,No,No,Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy automatic diagnosis using a deep learning approach.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is an uncommon cardiomyopathy characterised by a thick and spongy left ventricle wall caused by the high presence of trabeculae (hyper-trabeculation). Recently, the percentage of the trabecular volume to the total volume of the external wall of the left ventricle (VT%) has been proposed to diagnose this illness. METHODS: This paper presents the use of a deep learning-based method to measure the (VT%) value and diagnose this rare cardiomyopathy. The population used in this research was composed of 277 patients suffering from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 134 patients only suffered hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 143 also suffered left ventricular non-compaction. Our deep learning solution is based on a 2D U-Net. This artificial neural network (ANN) was trained on short-axis magnetic resonance imaging to segment the left ventricle's internal cavity, external wall, and trabecular tissue. 5-fold cross-validation was performed to ensure the robustness of the results. The Dice coefficient of the three classes was computed as a measure of the precision of the segmentation. Based on this segmentation, the percentage of the trabecular volume (VT%) was computed. Two specialist cardiologists rated the segmentation produced by the neural network for 25 patients to evaluate the clinical validity of the outputs. The computed VT% was used to automatically diagnose the 277 patients depending on whether or not a given threshold was exceeded. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was also performed. RESULTS: According to the cross-validation results, the average and standard deviation of the Dice coefficient for the internal cavity, external wall, and trabeculae were 0.96+/-0.00, 0.89+/-0.00, and 0.84+/-0.00, respectively. The cardiologists rated 99.5% of the evaluated segmentations as clinically valid for diagnosis, outperforming existing automatic traditional tools. The area under the ROC curve was 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.96). The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of diagnosis using a threshold of 25% were 0.87, 0.93, and 0.80, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The U-Net neural network can achieve excellent results in the delineation of different cardiac structures of short-axis cardiac MRI. The high-quality segmentation allows for the correct measurement of left ventricular hyper-trabeculation and a definitive diagnosis of LVNC illness. Using this kind of solution could lead to more objective and faster analysis, reducing human error and time spent by cardiologists."
34762648,No,Yes,No,No,"MitoScape: A big-data, machine-learning platform for obtaining mitochondrial DNA from next-generation sequencing data.","The growing number of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data presents a unique opportunity to study the combined impact of mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded genetic variation in complex disease. Mitochondrial DNA variants and in particular, heteroplasmic variants, are critical for determining human disease severity. While there are approaches for obtaining mitochondrial DNA variants from NGS data, these software do not account for the unique characteristics of mitochondrial genetics and can be inaccurate even for homoplasmic variants. We introduce MitoScape, a novel, big-data, software for extracting mitochondrial DNA sequences from NGS. MitoScape adopts a novel departure from other algorithms by using machine learning to model the unique characteristics of mitochondrial genetics. We also employ a novel approach of using rho-zero (mitochondrial DNA-depleted) data to model nuclear-encoded mitochondrial sequences. We showed that MitoScape produces accurate heteroplasmy estimates using gold-standard mitochondrial DNA data. We provide a comprehensive comparison of the most common tools for obtaining mtDNA variants from NGS and showed that MitoScape had superior performance to compared tools in every statistically category we compared, including false positives and false negatives. By applying MitoScape to common disease examples, we illustrate how MitoScape facilitates important heteroplasmy-disease association discoveries by expanding upon a reported association between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mitochondrial haplogroup T in men (adjusted p-value = 0.003). The improved accuracy of mitochondrial DNA variants produced by MitoScape will be instrumental in diagnosing disease in the context of personalized medicine and clinical diagnostics."
34757566,No,Yes,No,No,Using deep learning method to identify left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography.,"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent prognostic factor for cardiovascular events and it can be detected by echocardiography in the early stage. In this study, we aim to develop a semi-automatic diagnostic network based on deep learning algorithms to detect LVH. METHODS: We retrospectively collected 1610 transthoracic echocardiograms, included 724 patients [189 hypertensive heart disease (HHD), 218 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and 58 cardiac amyloidosis (CA), along with 259 controls]. The diagnosis of LVH was defined by two experienced clinicians. For the deep learning architecture, we introduced ResNet and U-net++ to complete classification and segmentation tasks respectively. The models were trained and validated independently. Then, we connected the best-performing models to form the final framework and tested its capabilities. RESULTS: In terms of individual networks, the view classification model produced AUC = 1.0. The AUC of the LVH detection model was 0.98 (95% CI 0.94-0.99), with corresponding sensitivity and specificity of 94.0% (95% CI 85.3-98.7%) and 91.6% (95% CI 84.6-96.1%) respectively. For etiology identification, the independent model yielded good results with AUC = 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-0.95) for HCM, AUC = 0.94 (95% CI 0.88-0.98) for CA, and AUC = 0.88 (95% CI 0.80-0.93) for HHD. Finally, our final integrated framework automatically classified four conditions (Normal, HCM, CA, and HHD), which achieved an average of AUC 0.91, with an average sensitivity and specificity of 83.7% and 90.0%. CONCLUSION: Deep learning architecture has the ability to detect LVH and even distinguish the latent etiology of LVH."
34573896,No,Yes,No,No,Classification of Cardiomyopathies from MR Cine Images Using Convolutional Neural Network with Transfer Learning.,"The automatic classification of various types of cardiomyopathies is desirable but has never been performed using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The purpose of this study was to evaluate currently available CNN models to classify cine magnetic resonance (cine-MR) images of cardiomyopathies. METHOD: Diastolic and systolic frames of 1200 cine-MR sequences of three categories of subjects (395 normal, 411 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 394 dilated cardiomyopathy) were selected, preprocessed, and labeled. Pretrained, fine-tuned deep learning models (VGG) were used for image classification (sixfold cross-validation and double split testing with hold-out data). The heat activation map algorithm (Grad-CAM) was applied to reveal salient pixel areas leading to the classification. RESULTS: The diastolic-systolic dual-input concatenated VGG model cross-validation accuracy was 0.982 +/- 0.009. Summed confusion matrices showed that, for the 1200 inputs, the VGG model led to 22 errors. The classification of a 227-input validation group, carried out by an experienced radiologist and cardiologist, led to a similar number of discrepancies. The image preparation process led to 5% accuracy improvement as compared to nonprepared images. Grad-CAM heat activation maps showed that most misclassifications occurred when extracardiac location caught the attention of the network. CONCLUSIONS: CNN networks are very well suited and are 98% accurate for the classification of cardiomyopathies, regardless of the imaging plane, when both diastolic and systolic frames are incorporated. Misclassification is in the same range as inter-observer discrepancies in experienced human readers."
34532095,No,Yes,No,No,Diagnostic and prognostic value of MATN3 expression in gastric carcinoma: TCGA database mining.,"BACKGROUNDS: Globally, the high morbidity and mortality of gastric carcinoma (GC) have been one of the great challenges facing humanity. However, the early diagnosis of GC is still unknown. Matrilin-3 (MATN3) is a member of the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein family. Previous studies have reported a correlation between the expression of MATN3 and bone disease. However, the role of MATN3 in GC has not been reported in depth, which can have a possible far-reaching implication for GC. METHODS: We explored the diagnostic and prognostic value and pathway enrichment of MATN3 expression in GC. Limma package conducted by R was used to analysis the difference expression data of MATN3 from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to estimate the diagnostic value of MATN3 expression. univariate and multivariate analysis were used to assess the prognostic value of MATN3, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify the enriched signaling pathways. RESULTS: MATN3 was found to be significantly higher in GC tissue samples. GC patients with high MATN3 expression had poor prognosis. Then, GSEA showed that the gene sets were correlated with signaling pathways including ECM receptor interaction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis chondroitin sulfate, among others. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that MATN3 can serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for GC."

In this COVID-19 era of sustainable health care delivery, SE2030 will provide the evidence to finally recommend SE as the optimal and versatile imaging modality for functional testing anywhere, any time, and in any patient."
34170197,No,Yes,No,No,Deep learning-based automated left ventricular ejection fraction assessment using 2-D echocardiography.,"Deep learning (DL) has been applied for automatic left ventricle (LV) ejection fraction (EF) measurement, but the diagnostic performance was rarely evaluated for various phenotypes of heart disease. This study aims to evaluate a new DL algorithm for automated LVEF measurement using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) images collected from three centers. The impact of three ultrasound machines and three phenotypes of heart diseases on the automatic LVEF measurement was evaluated. Using 36890 frames of 2DE from 340 patients, we developed a DL algorithm based on U-Net (DPS-Net) and the biplane Simpson's method was applied for LVEF calculation. Results showed a high performance in LV segmentation and LVEF measurement across phenotypes and echo systems by using DPS-Net. Good performance was obtained for LV segmentation when DPS-Net was tested on the CAMUS data set (Dice coefficient of 0.932 and 0.928 for ED and ES). Better performance of LV segmentation in study-wise evaluation was observed by comparing the DPS-Net v2 to the EchoNet-dynamic algorithm (P = 0.008). DPS-Net was associated with high correlations and good agreements for the LVEF measurement. High diagnostic performance was obtained that the area under receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.974, 0.948, 0.968, and 0.972 for normal hearts and disease phenotypes including atrial fibrillation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, respectively. High performance was obtained by using DPS-Net in LV detection and LVEF measurement for heart failure with several phenotypes. High performance was observed in a large-scale dataset, suggesting that the DPS-Net was highly adaptive across different echocardiographic systems.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A new strategy of feature extraction and fusion could enhance the accuracy of automatic LVEF assessment based on multiview 2-D echocardiographic sequences. High diagnostic performance for the determination of heart failure was obtained by using DPS-Net in cases with different phenotypes of heart diseases. High performance for left ventricle segmentation was obtained by using DPS-Net, suggesting the potential for a wider range of application in the interpretation of 2DE images."
34163525,No,Yes,No,No,Automated Facial Recognition for Noonan Syndrome Using Novel Deep Convolutional Neural Network With Additive Angular Margin Loss.,"BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome (NS), a genetically heterogeneous disorder, presents with hypertelorism, ptosis, dysplastic pulmonary valve stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and small stature. Early detection and assessment of NS are crucial to formulating an individualized treatment protocol. However, the diagnostic rate of pediatricians and pediatric cardiologists is limited. To overcome this challenge, we propose an automated facial recognition model to identify NS using a novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with a loss function called additive angular margin loss (ArcFace). METHODS: The proposed automated facial recognition models were trained on dataset that included 127 NS patients, 163 healthy children, and 130 children with several other dysmorphic syndromes. The photo dataset contained only one frontal face image from each participant. A novel DCNN framework with ArcFace loss function (DCNN-Arcface model) was constructed. Two traditional machine learning models and a DCNN model with cross-entropy loss function (DCNN-CE model) were also constructed. Transfer learning and data augmentation were applied in the training process. The identification performance of facial recognition models was assessed by five-fold cross-validation. Comparison of the DCNN-Arcface model to two traditional machine learning models, the DCNN-CE model, and six physicians were performed. RESULTS: At distinguishing NS patients from healthy children, the DCNN-Arcface model achieved an accuracy of 0.9201 +/- 0.0138 and an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9797 +/- 0.0055. At distinguishing NS patients from children with several other genetic syndromes, it achieved an accuracy of 0.8171 +/- 0.0074 and an AUC of 0.9274 +/- 0.0062. In both cases, the DCNN-Arcface model outperformed the two traditional machine learning models, the DCNN-CE model, and six physicians. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the proposed DCNN-Arcface model is a promising way to screen NS patients and can improve the NS diagnosis rate."
34118751,No,Yes,No,No,A computational pipeline for data augmentation towards the improvement of disease classification and risk stratification models: A case study in two clinical domains.,"Virtual population generation is an emerging field in data science with numerous applications in healthcare towards the augmentation of clinical research databases with significant lack of population size. However, the impact of data augmentation on the development of AI (artificial intelligence) models to address clinical unmet needs has not yet been investigated. In this work, we assess whether the aggregation of real with virtual patient data can improve the performance of the existing risk stratification and disease classification models in two rare clinical domains, namely the primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS) and the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), for the first time in the literature. To do so, multivariate approaches, such as, the multivariate normal distribution (MVND), and straightforward ones, such as, the Bayesian networks, the artificial neural networks (ANNs), and the tree ensembles are compared against their performance towards the generation of high-quality virtual data. Both boosting and bagging algorithms, such as, the Gradient boosting trees (XGBoost), the AdaBoost and the Random Forests (RFs) were trained on the augmented data to evaluate the performance improvement for lymphoma classification and HCM risk stratification. Our results revealed the favorable performance of the tree ensemble generators, in both domains, yielding virtual data with goodness-of-fit 0.021 and KL-divergence 0.029 in pSS and 0.029, 0.027 in HCM, respectively. The application of the XGBoost on the augmented data revealed an increase by 10.9% in accuracy, 10.7% in sensitivity, 11.5% in specificity for lymphoma classification and 16.1% in accuracy, 16.9% in sensitivity, 13.7% in specificity in HCM risk stratification."
33599043,No,Yes,No,No,Improved Quantification of Myocardium Scar in Late Gadolinium Enhancement Images: Deep Learning Based Image Fusion Approach.,"BACKGROUND: Quantification of myocardium scarring in late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can be challenging due to low scar-to-background contrast and low image quality. To resolve ambiguous LGE regions, experienced readers often use conventional cine sequences to accurately identify the myocardium borders. PURPOSE: To develop a deep learning model for combining LGE and cine images to improve the robustness and accuracy of LGE scar quantification. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: A total of 191 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients: 1) 162 patients from two sites randomly split into training (50%; 81 patients), validation (25%, 40 patients), and testing (25%; 41 patients); and 2) an external testing dataset (29 patients) from a third site. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5T, inversion-recovery segmented gradient-echo LGE and balanced steady-state free-precession cine sequences ASSESSMENT: Two convolutional neural networks (CNN) were trained for myocardium and scar segmentation, one with and one without LGE-Cine fusion. For CNN with fusion, the input was two aligned LGE and cine images at matched cardiac phase and anatomical location. For CNN without fusion, only LGE images were used as input. Manual segmentation of the datasets was used as reference standard. STATISTICAL TESTS: Manual and CNN-based quantifications of LGE scar burden and of myocardial volume were assessed using Pearson linear correlation coefficients (r) and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Both CNN models showed strong agreement with manual quantification of LGE scar burden and myocardium volume. CNN with LGE-Cine fusion was more robust than CNN without LGE-Cine fusion, allowing for successful segmentation of significantly more slices (603 [95%] vs. 562 (89%) of 635 slices; P < 0.001). Also, CNN with LGE-Cine fusion showed better agreement with manual quantification of LGE scar burden than CNN without LGE-Cine fusion (%Scar(LGE-cine) = 0.82 x %Scar(manual) , r = 0.84 vs. %Scar(LGE)  = 0.47 x %Scar(manual) , r = 0.81) and myocardium volume (Volume(LGE-cine) = 1.03 x Volume(manual) , r = 0.96 vs. Volume(LGE)  = 0.91 x Volume(manual) , r = 0.91). DATA CONCLUSION: CNN based LGE-Cine fusion can improve the robustness and accuracy of automated scar quantification. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: 1."
33569410,No,Yes,No,No,Artificial intelligence-based myocardial texture analysis in etiological differentiation of left ventricular hypertrophy.,"BACKGROUND: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is widely used in clinics to evaluate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However, TTE is usually insufficient for the etiological diagnoses when morphological and functional features are nonspecific. With the booming of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI), previous literature has reported the application of radiomics based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac computed tomography and TTE in diagnosing several myocardial abnormalities, such as myocardial infarction, myocarditis, cardiac amyloidosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In this study, we explored the possibility of using myocardial texture features in differentiating HCM, hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and uremic cardiomyopathy (UCM) based on echocardiography. To our knowledge, this was the first study to explore TTE myocardial texture analysis for multiple LVH etiology differentiation. METHODS: TTE images were reviewed retrospectively from January 2018 to collect 50 cases for each group of HHD, HCM and UCM. The apical four chamber view was retrieved. Seventeen first-order statistics and 60 gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features were extracted for statistics and classification test by support vector machine (SVM). RESULTS: Of all the parameters, entropy of brightness (EtBrt), standard deviation (Std), coefficient of variation (CoV), skewness (Skew), contrast7 (Cont7) and homogeneity5 (Hm5) were found statistically significant among the three groups (all P<0.05) and with acceptable reproducibility (intraobserver and interobserver ICC >0.50). As a result, HCM showed the most homogeneous myocardial texture, and was significantly different from HHD and UCM (all six features: P</=0.005). HHD appeared slightly more homogeneous than UCM, as only EtBrt and CoV were significant (P=0.011 and P=0.008). According to higher areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (>0.50), EtBrt, Std, and CoV were selected for test of classification as a combination of features. The AUC derived from SVM model was slightly improved compared with those of EtBrt, Std and CoV individually. CONCLUSIONS: AI-based myocardial texture analysis using ultrasonic images may be a potential approach to aiding LVH etiology differentiation."
33484944,No,Yes,No,No,"A fast, accurate, and generalisable heuristic-based negation detection algorithm for clinical text.","Negation detection is an important task in biomedical text mining. Particularly in clinical settings, it is of critical importance to determine whether findings mentioned in text are present or absent. Rule-based negation detection algorithms are a common approach to the task, and more recent investigations have resulted in the development of rule-based systems utilising the rich grammatical information afforded by typed dependency graphs. However, interacting with these complex representations inevitably necessitates complex rules, which are time-consuming to develop and do not generalise well. We hypothesise that a heuristic approach to determining negation via dependency graphs could offer a powerful alternative. We describe and implement an algorithm for negation detection based on grammatical distance from a negatory construct in a typed dependency graph. To evaluate the algorithm, we develop two testing corpora comprised of sentences of clinical text extracted from the MIMIC-III database and documents related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients routinely collected at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS trust. Gold-standard validation datasets were built by a combination of human annotation and examination of algorithm error. Finally, we compare the performance of our approach with four other rule-based algorithms on both gold-standard corpora. The presented algorithm exhibits the best performance by f-measure over the MIMIC-III dataset, and a similar performance to the syntactic negation detection systems over the HCM dataset. It is also the fastest of the dependency-based negation systems explored in this study. Our results show that while a single heuristic approach to dependency-based negation detection is ignorant to certain advanced cases, it nevertheless forms a powerful and stable method, requiring minimal training and adaptation between datasets. As such, it could present a drop-in replacement or augmentation for many-rule negation approaches in clinical text-mining pipelines, particularly for cases where adaptation and rule development is not required or possible."
33293182,No,Yes,No,No,Cardiac magnetic resonance image diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy based on a double-branch neural network.,"OBJECTIVE: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a well-established technique for diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and evaluation of cardiac function, but the process is complicated and time consuming. Therefore, this paper proposes a cardiomyopathy recognition algorithm using a multi-task learning mechanism and a double-branch deep learning neural network. METHOD: We implemented a double-branch neural network CMR-based HOCM recognition algorithm. Compared with the traditional classification algorithms such as the ResNet, DenseNet network, contrast the accuracy of network classification of cardiomyopathy is higher by 10.11%. RESULT: The loss curve of the algorithm basically converges in 100 rounds, and the convergence speed of the algorithm is twice that of the traditional algorithm. The accuracy of this algorithm to classify cardiomyopathy is 96.79%, and the sensitivity is 95.24%, which is 10.11% higher than the conventional algorithm. CONCLUSION: The CMR imaging automatic recognition algorithm for HOCM capture static morphological and motion characteristics of the heart, and comprehensively enhances recognition accuracy when the sample size is limited."
33246415,No,Yes,No,No,Comparative transcriptome analysis of scaled and scaleless skins in Gymnocypris eckloni provides insights into the molecular mechanism of scale degeneration.,"BACKGROUND: The scale degeneration is thought to be related to the adaptation to the extreme environment with cold climate and high-altitude in schizothoracine fishes. Gymnocypris eckloni, a schizothoracine fish living in plateau waters with the elevation above 2500 m, is nearly esquamate and only covered with shoulder scales and anal scales, making it a good model species to study the molecular mechanism of scale degeneration. RESULTS: The transcriptomes of shoulder scaled skins (SSS), anal scaled skins (ASS) and scaleless skins (NSS) were sequenced and analyzed in G. eckloni at the age of 1 year. Histological examination showed that shoulder scale had completed its differentiation and anal scale just initiated the differentiation. A total of 578,046 unigenes were obtained from the transcriptomes, with 407,799 unigenes annotated in public databases. A total of 428 and 142 differentially expressed unigenes (DEUs) were identified between SSS and NSS, and between ASS and NSS, respectively, with 45 DEUs that were overlapped. Annotation analysis indicated that these DEUs were mainly enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways associated with bone and muscle formation, such as myofibril, contractile fiber, cytoskeletal protein binding, muscle structure development, cardiac muscle contraction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and calcium signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our results would provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of scale degeneration in G. eckloni and other congeneric fishes. In addition, the transcriptome data provides candidate genes and markers for future studies."
33131085,No,Yes,No,No,Evaluation of fully automated myocardial segmentation techniques in native and contrast-enhanced T1-mapping cardiovascular magnetic resonance images using fully convolutional neural networks.,"PURPOSE: T1-mapping cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging permits noninvasive quantification of myocardial fibrosis (MF); however, manual delineation of myocardial boundaries is time-consuming and introduces user-dependent variability for such measurements. In this study, we compare several automated pipelines for myocardial segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in native and contrast-enhanced T1-maps using fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs). METHODS: Sixty patients with known MF across three distinct cardiomyopathy states (20 ischemic (ICM), 20 dilated (DCM), and 20 hypertrophic (HCM)) underwent a standard CMR imaging protocol inclusive of cinematic (CINE), late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and pre/post-contrast T1 imaging. Native and contrast-enhanced T1-mapping was performed using a shortened modified Look-Locker imaging (shMOLLI) technique at the basal, mid-level, and/or apex of the LV. Myocardial segmentations in native and post-contrast T1-maps were performed using three state-of-the-art CNN-based methods: standard U-Net, densely connected neural networks (Dense Nets), and attention networks (Attention Nets) after dividing the dataset using fivefold cross validation. These direct segmentation techniques were compared to an alternative registration-based segmentation method, wherein spatially corresponding CINE images are segmented automatically using U-Net, and a nonrigid registration technique transforms and propagates CINE contours to the myocardial regions of T1-maps. The methodologies were validated in 125 native and 100 contrast-enhanced T1-maps using standard segmentation accuracy metrics. Pearson correlation coefficient r and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare the computed global T1 values derived by manual, U-Net, and CINE registration methodologies. RESULTS: The U-Net-based method yielded optimal results in myocardial segmentation of native, contrast-enhanced, and CINE images compared to Dense Nets and Attention Nets. The direct U-Net-based method outperformed the CINE registration-based method in native T1-maps, yielding Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 82.7 +/- 12% compared to 81.4 +/- 6.9% (P < 0.0001). However, in contrast-enhanced T1-maps, the CINE-registration-based method outperformed direct U-Net segmentation, yielding DSC of 77.0 +/- 9.6% vs 74.2 +/- 18% across all patient groups (P = 0.0014) and specifically 73.2 +/- 7.3% vs 65.5 +/- 18% in the ICM patient group. High linear correlation of global T1 values was demonstrated in Pearson analysis of the U-Net-based technique and the CINE-registration technique in both native T1-maps (r = 0.93, P < 0.0001 and r = 0.87, P < 0.0001, respectively) and contrast-enhanced T1-maps (r = 0.93, P < 0.0001 and r = 0.98, P < 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The direct U-Net-based myocardial segmentation technique provided accurate, fully automated segmentations in native and contrast-enhanced T1-maps. Myocardial borders can alternatively be segmented from spatially matched CINE images and applied to T1-maps via deformation and propagation through a modality-independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND). The direct U-Net approach is more efficient in myocardial segmentation of native T1-maps and eliminates cross-technique dependence. However, the CINE-registration-based technique may be more appropriate for contrast-enhanced T1-maps and/or for patients with dense regions of replacement fibrosis, such as those with ICM."
33046849,No,Yes,No,No,Disease-specific variant pathogenicity prediction significantly improves variant interpretation in inherited cardiac conditions.,"PURPOSE: Accurate discrimination of benign and pathogenic rare variation remains a priority for clinical genome interpretation. State-of-the-art machine learning variant prioritization tools are imprecise and ignore important parameters defining gene-disease relationships, e.g., distinct consequences of gain-of-function versus loss-of-function variants. We hypothesized that incorporating disease-specific information would improve tool performance. METHODS: We developed a disease-specific variant classifier, CardioBoost, that estimates the probability of pathogenicity for rare missense variants in inherited cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias. We assessed CardioBoost's ability to discriminate known pathogenic from benign variants, prioritize disease-associated variants, and stratify patient outcomes. RESULTS: CardioBoost has high global discrimination accuracy (precision recall area under the curve [AUC] 0.91 for cardiomyopathies; 0.96 for arrhythmias), outperforming existing tools (4-24% improvement). CardioBoost obtains excellent accuracy (cardiomyopathies 90.2%; arrhythmias 91.9%) for variants classified with >90% confidence, and increases the proportion of variants classified with high confidence more than twofold compared with existing tools. Variants classified as disease-causing are associated with both disease status and clinical severity, including a 21% increased risk (95% confidence interval [CI] 11-29%) of severe adverse outcomes by age 60 in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: A disease-specific variant classifier outperforms state-of-the-art genome-wide tools for rare missense variants in inherited cardiac conditions ( https://www.cardiodb.org/cardioboost/ ), highlighting broad opportunities for improved pathogenicity prediction through disease specificity."
32749209,No,Yes,No,No,Cardiovascular CT and MRI in 2019: Review of Key Articles.,"Cardiac imaging is becoming commonplace throughout radiology practices and is increasingly important in large-cohort prospective cardiovascular trials and in statements and guidelines. In this review, the authors summarize some of the most important imaging findings relevant to clinical practice in the past year. Key coronary CT angiography studies have included rigorous meta-analysis of its diagnostic accuracy, prognostic implications of adverse coronary plaque features, and sex differences. The value of CT for catheter-delivered valve implantation (eg, transcatheter aortic and mitral valve replacements) was further elucidated in large-cohort outcome trials. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy registries have revealed distinct clinical and MRI phenotypes, highlighting different underlying causes, while others clarified the prognostic usefulness of MRI in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Fabry disease. Artificial intelligence and/or machine learning was applied to many aspects of cardiovascular imaging, while evidence of the benefits of both adenosine stress perfusion cardiac MRI and coronary CT angiography-derived fractional flow reserve from real-world trials has increased. Studies on vaping and vascular endothelial function and the whole-body MRI depiction of metabolic syndrome consequences were also noteworthy. Although this review focuses on Radiology articles, key articles from high-impact clinical journals are also included. Although not possible to detail all articles because of space limitations, the authors attempted to highlight those with the most pragmatic and scientific value."
32564357,No,Yes,No,No,Temporally coherent cardiac motion tracking from cine MRI: Traditional registration method and modern CNN method.,"PURPOSE: Cardiac motion tracking enables quantitative evaluation of myocardial strain, which is clinically interesting in cardiovascular disease research. However, motion tracking is difficult to perform manually. In this paper, we aim to develop and compare two fully automated motion tracking methods for the steady state free precession (SSFP) cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and explore their use in real clinical scenario with different patient groups. METHODS: We proposed two automated cardiac motion tracking method: (a) a traditional registration-based method, named full cardiac cycle registration, which simultaneously tracks all cine frames within a full cardiac cycle by joint registration of all frames; and (b) a modern convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method, named Groupwise MotionNet, which enhances the temporal coherence by fusing motion along a continuous time scale. Both methods were evaluated on the healthy volunteer data from the MICCAI 2011 STACOM Challenge, as well as on patient data including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and myocardial infarction (MI). RESULTS: The full cardiac cycle registration method achieved an average end-point error (EPE) 2.89 +/- 1.57 mm for cardiac motion tracking, with computation time of around 9 min per short-axis cine MRI (size 128 x 128, 30 cardiac phases). In comparison, the Groupwise MotionNet achieved an average EPE of 0.94 +/- 1.59 mm, taking < 1 s for a full cardiac phases. Further experiments showed that registration method had stable performance, independent of patient cohort and MRI machine, while the CNN-based method relied on the training data to deliver consistently accurate results. CONCLUSION: Both registration-based and CNN-based method can track the cardiac motion from SSFP cine MRI in a fully automated manner, while taking temporal coherence into account. The registration method is generic, robust, but relatively slow; the CNN-based method trained with heterogeneous data was able to achieve high tracking accuracy with real-time performance."
32479518,No,Yes,No,No,Characterization of interstitial diffuse fibrosis patterns using texture analysis of myocardial native T1 mapping.,"BACKGROUND: The pattern of myocardial fibrosis differs significantly between different cardiomyopathies. Fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characteristically as patchy and regional but in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as diffuse and global. We sought to investigate if texture analyses on myocardial native T1 mapping can differentiate between fibrosis patterns in patients with HCM and DCM. METHODS: We prospectively acquired native myocardial T1 mapping images for 321 subjects (55+/-15 years, 70% male): 65 control, 116 HCM, and 140 DCM patients. To quantify different fibrosis patterns, four sets of texture descriptors were used to extract 152 texture features from native T1 maps. Seven features were sequentially selected to identify HCM- and DCM-specific patterns in 70% of data (training dataset). Pattern reproducibility and generalizability were tested on the rest of data (testing dataset) using support vector machines (SVM) and regression models. RESULTS: Pattern-derived texture features were capable to identify subjects in HCM, DCM, and controls cohorts with 202/237(85.2%) accuracy of all subjects in the training dataset using 10-fold cross-validation on SVM (AUC = 0.93, 0.93, and 0.93 for controls, HCM and DCM, respectively), while pattern-independent global native T1 mapping was poorly capable to identify those subjects with 121/237(51.1%) accuracy (AUC = 0.78, 0.51, and 0.74) (P<0.001 for all). The pattern-derived features were reproducible with excellent intra- and inter-observer reliability and generalizable on the testing dataset with 75/84(89.3%) accuracy. CONCLUSION: Texture analysis of myocardial native T1 mapping can characterize fibrosis patterns in HCM and DCM patients and provides additional information beyond average native T1 values."
32134392,No,Yes,No,No,Thanatogenomic Investigation of the Hydroxymethylome and Mitochondrial Genome of Cadaveric Cardiomyocytes: Proposal for a Proof-of-Concept Study.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). One of the common CVDs is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Recent studies conducted in heart cells of mice have shown that this condition involves a chemical modification called hydroxymethylation of the DNA of heart cells. OBJECTIVE: Objectives of the proposed research are to profile the distribution of 5-hydroxymethylation in the cardiomyocyte (CMC) genome of cadaveric cardiac tissue and cardiac biopsy specimens; to compare the hydroxymethylome of cadaveric CMCs with that of cardiac biopsy specimens from HCM patients and/or cardiac transplant patients (control) undergoing cardiac catheterization; to histologically appraise sarcomere distribution and mitochondrial morphology of CMCs in the presence of HCM; to correlate the mitochondrial genome with the HCM phenotype; and to integrate anatomy with biochemistry and genetics into the instructional design of HCM in the core medical curriculum at Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences (MBRU). METHODS: Normal and hypertrophic heart specimens will be obtained from 8 whole-body cadavers (2/8, 25% control and 6/8, 75% HCM). Myocardial biopsy specimens will be obtained from cardiothoracic and transplant units at the Cleveland Clinic in Abu Dhabi, UAE. As this is a proof-of-concept study, we plan to recruit 5 patients with HCM, where HCM has been diagnosed according to the guidelines of the 2014 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines. Patients with valvular heart disease, history of myocarditis, regular alcohol consumption, or cardiotoxic chemotherapy will be excluded. The control biopsy specimens will be obtained from patients who had received heart transplants. Three investigational approaches will then be employed: (1) gross anatomical evaluation, (2) histological analysis, and (3) profiling and analysis of the hydroxymethylome. These investigations will be pursued with minor modifications, if required, to the standard protocols and in accordance with institutional policy. The objective associated with the education of health professionals will be addressed through a strategy based on Graham's knowledge translation model. RESULTS: This study is at the protocol-development stage. The validated questionnaires have been identified in relation to the objectives. The MBRU and the Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi Institutional Review Board (IRB) are reviewing this study. Further clarification and information can be obtained from the MBRU IRB. There is funding in place for this study (MBRU-CM-RG2019-08). Currently, we are in the process of standardizing the protocols with respect to the various molecular techniques to be employed during the course of the study. The total duration of the proposed research is 24 months, with a provision for 6 months of a no-cost extension. CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of CVDs has recently received significant focus from the public health sector in the UAE. HCM is a common familial heart disease, contributing to the sudden increase in the mortality rate of young Emiratis in the UAE. Incorporating artificial intelligence into the identification of epigenetic risk factors associated with HCM will promote accurate diagnosis and lead to the development of improved management plans, hence, positive patient outcomes. Furthermore, integration of these findings into the instructional design of undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuous professional development medical curricula will further contribute to the body of knowledge regarding HCM.

31813486,No,Yes,No,No,A predictive analytics framework for identifying patients at risk of developing multiple medical complications caused by chronic diseases.,"Chronic diseases often cause several medical complications. This paper aims to predict multiple complications among patients with a chronic disease. The literature uses single-task learning algorithms to predict complications independently and assumes no correlation among complications of chronic diseases. We propose two methods (independent prediction of complications with single-task learning and concurrent prediction of complications with multi-task learning) and show that medical complications of chronic diseases can be correlated. We use a case study and compare the performance of these two methods by predicting complications of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy on 106 predictors in 1078 electronic medical records from April 2009-April 2017, inclusive. The methods are implemented using logistic regression, artificial neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. The results show multi-task learning with logistic regression improves the performance of predictions in terms of both discrimination and calibration."
31767831,No,Yes,No,No,Kindlin-2 suppresses transcription factor GATA4 through interaction with SUV39H1 to attenuate hypertrophy.,"Kindlin-2 plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac structure and function. Depletion of Kindlin-2 contributes to cardiac hypertrophy and progressive heart failure, however, the precise mechanisms involved in this process remain unclear. GATA4 is a critical transcription factor in regulating cardiogenesis. We found that Kindlin-2 suppresses the expression of GATA4 through binding to its promoter and prevents cardiomyocytes from hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol (ISO) treatment. Mechanistically, Kindlin-2 interacts with histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 and recruits it to GATA4 promoter leading to the occupancy of histone H3K9 di- and tri-methylation. Furthermore, to confirm the function of Kindlin-2 in vivo, we generated mice with targeted deletion of cardiac Kindlin-2. We found that 6-month-old Kindlin-2 cKO mice have developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and that this pathological process can be accelerated by ISO-treatment. GATA4 expression was markedly activated in cardiac tissues of Kindlin-2 cKO mice compared to wild-type animals. Collectively, our data revealed that Kindlin-2 suppresses GATA4 expression by triggering histone H3K9 methylation in part and protects heart from pathological hypertrophy."
31671341,No,Yes,No,No,Automatic myocardial segmentation in dynamic contrast enhanced perfusion MRI using Monte Carlo dropout in an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cardiac perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with first pass dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) is a useful tool to identify perfusion defects in myocardial tissues. Automatic segmentation of the myocardium can lead to efficient quantification of perfusion defects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of uncertainty estimation in deep convolutional neural networks for automatic myocardial segmentation. METHODS: A U-Net segmentation model was trained on the cardiac cine data. Monte Carlo dropout sampling of the U-Net model was performed on the dynamic perfusion datasets frame-by-frame to estimate the standard deviation (SD) maps. The uncertainty estimate based on the sum of the SD values was used to select the optimal frames for endocardial and epicardial segmentations. DCE perfusion data from 35 subjects (14 subjects with coronary artery disease, 8 subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 13 healthy volunteers) were evaluated. The Dice similarity scores of the proposed method were compared with those of a semi-automatic U-Net segmentation method, which involved user selection of an image frame for segmentation in the cardiac perfusion dataset. RESULTS: The proposed method was fully automatic and did not require manual labeling of the cardiac perfusion image data for model development. The mean Dice similarity score of the proposed automatic method was 0.806 (+/-0.096), which was comparable to the 0.808 (+/-0.084) Dice score of the semi-automatic U-Net segmentation method (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.61, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the feasibility of applying an existing model trained on cardiac cine data to dynamic cardiac perfusion data to achieve robust and automatic segmentation of the myocardium. The uncertainty estimates can be used for screening purposes, which would facilitate the cases with high endocardial and epicardial uncertainty estimates to be sent for further evaluation and correction by human experts."
30677223,No,Yes,No,No,An integrative systems approach identifies novel candidates in Marfan syndrome-related pathophysiology.,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene. Although many peripheral tissues are affected, aortic complications, such as dilation, dissection and rupture, are the leading causes of MFS-related mortality. Aberrant TGF-beta signalling plays a major role in the pathophysiology of MFS. However, the contributing mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we aimed at identifying novel aorta-specific pathways involved in the pathophysiology of MFS. For this purpose, we employed the Fbn1 under-expressing mgR/mgR mouse model of MFS. We performed RNA-sequencing of aortic tissues of 9-week-old mgR/mgR mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. With a false discovery rate <5%, our analysis revealed 248 genes to be differentially regulated including 20 genes previously unrelated with MFS-related pathology. Among these, we identified Igfbp2, Ccl8, Spp1, Mylk2, Mfap4, Dsp and H19. We confirmed the expression of regulated genes by quantitative real-time PCR. Pathway classification revealed transcript signatures involved in chemokine signalling, cardiac muscle contraction, dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, our immunoblot analysis of aortic tissues revealed altered regulation of pSmad2 signalling, Perk1/2, Igfbp2, Mfap4, Ccl8 and Mylk2 protein levels in mgR/mgR vs WT mice. Together, our integrative systems approach identified several novel factors associated with MFS-aortic-specific pathophysiology that might offer potential novel therapeutic targets for MFS."
30354459,No,Yes,No,No,Fully Automated Echocardiogram Interpretation in Clinical Practice.,"BACKGROUND: Automated cardiac image interpretation has the potential to transform clinical practice in multiple ways, including enabling serial assessment of cardiac function by nonexperts in primary care and rural settings. We hypothesized that advances in computer vision could enable building a fully automated, scalable analysis pipeline for echocardiogram interpretation, including (1) view identification, (2) image segmentation, (3) quantification of structure and function, and (4) disease detection. METHODS: Using 14 035 echocardiograms spanning a 10-year period, we trained and evaluated convolutional neural network models for multiple tasks, including automated identification of 23 viewpoints and segmentation of cardiac chambers across 5 common views. The segmentation output was used to quantify chamber volumes and left ventricular mass, determine ejection fraction, and facilitate automated determination of longitudinal strain through speckle tracking. Results were evaluated through comparison to manual segmentation and measurements from 8666 echocardiograms obtained during the routine clinical workflow. Finally, we developed models to detect 3 diseases: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. RESULTS: Convolutional neural networks accurately identified views (eg, 96% for parasternal long axis), including flagging partially obscured cardiac chambers, and enabled the segmentation of individual cardiac chambers. The resulting cardiac structure measurements agreed with study report values (eg, median absolute deviations of 15% to 17% of observed values for left ventricular mass, left ventricular diastolic volume, and left atrial volume). In terms of function, we computed automated ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts), which agreed with commercial software-derived values (for ejection fraction, median absolute deviation=9.7% of observed, N=6407 studies; for strain, median absolute deviation=7.5%, n=419, and 9.0%, n=110) and demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of patients with breast cancer for trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found automated measurements to be comparable or superior to manual measurements across 11 internal consistency metrics (eg, the correlation of left atrial and ventricular volumes). Finally, we trained convolutional neural networks to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension with C statistics of 0.93, 0.87, and 0.85, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our pipeline lays the groundwork for using automated interpretation to support serial patient tracking and scalable analysis of millions of echocardiograms archived within healthcare systems."
30066903,No,Yes,No,No,LncRNA and mRNA interaction study based on transcriptome profiles reveals potential core genes in the pathogenesis of human thoracic aortic dissection.,"The aim of the present study was to determine the potential core genes in the pathogenesis of human thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) by analyzing microarray profiles of long non‑coding (lnc)‑RNAs between TAD and normal thoracic aorta (NTA). The differentially expressed lncRNA profiles of the aorta tissues between TAD patients (TAD group, n=6) and age‑matched donors with aortic diseases (NTA group, n=6) were analyzed by lncRNAs microarray. Gene ontology (GO), pathway and network analyses were used to further investigate candidate lncRNAs and mRNAs. Differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were validated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). In total, the present study identified 765 lncRNAs and 619 mRNAs with differential expression between TAD and NTA (fold change >2.0, P<0.01). GO analysis demonstrated that the differentially upregulated lncRNAs are associated with cell differentiation, homeostasis, cell growth and angiogenesis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes pathway analysis demonstrated that the differentially downregulated lncRNAs are mainly associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy. To reduce the lncRNAs for further investigation and to enrich those potentially involved in TAD, a total of 16 candidate lncRNAs with a significant expression (fold change >4, P<0.01) were selected, that were associated with an annotated protein‑coding gene through the GO term and scientific literatures. Then a set of significantly expressed lncRNAs [purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2RX7), hypoxia inducing factor (HIF)‑1A‑AS2, AX746823, RP11‑69I8.3 and RP11‑536K7.5) and the corresponding mRNAs (P2RX7, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B, HIF‑1A, runt‑related transcription factor 1, connective tissue growth factor and interleukin 2 receptor a chain] were confirmed using RT‑qPCR. The present study revealed that the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in aorta tissues from TAD were significantly altered. These results may provide important insights into the pathogenesis of TAD disease."
29857330,No,Yes,No,No,"Omega-Net (Omega-Net): Fully automatic, multi-view cardiac MR detection, orientation, and segmentation with deep neural networks.","Pixelwise segmentation of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium and the four cardiac chambers in 2-D steady state free precession (SSFP) cine sequences is an essential preprocessing step for a wide range of analyses. Variability in contrast, appearance, orientation, and placement of the heart between patients, clinical views, scanners, and protocols makes fully automatic semantic segmentation a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we present Omega-Net (Omega-Net): A novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for simultaneous localization, transformation into a canonical orientation, and semantic segmentation. First, an initial segmentation is performed on the input image; second, the features learned during this initial segmentation are used to predict the parameters needed to transform the input image into a canonical orientation; and third, a final segmentation is performed on the transformed image. In this work, Omega-Nets of varying depths were trained to detect five foreground classes in any of three clinical views (short axis, SA; four-chamber, 4C; two-chamber, 2C), without prior knowledge of the view being segmented. This constitutes a substantially more challenging problem compared with prior work. The architecture was trained using three-fold cross-validation on a cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, N=42) and healthy control subjects (N=21). Network performance, as measured by weighted foreground intersection-over-union (IoU), was substantially improved for the best-performing Omega-Net compared with U-Net segmentation without localization or orientation (0.858 vs 0.834). In addition, to be comparable with other works, Omega-Net was retrained from scratch using five-fold cross-validation on the publicly available 2017 MICCAI Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset. The Omega-Net outperformed the state-of-the-art method in segmentation of the LV and RV bloodpools, and performed slightly worse in segmentation of the LV myocardium. We conclude that this architecture represents a substantive advancement over prior approaches, with implications for biomedical image segmentation more generally."
28130861,No,Yes,No,No,An assessment of left atrial function in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy before and 1 year after septal ablation by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess left atrial (LA) function with two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) in addition to standard echocardiographic assessments in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) before and 1 year after septal ablation (SA). METHODS: The study included 31 patients with HOCM, who underwent SA. Each patient with HOCM underwent a complete two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 year after the SA. The measurements included basal septal thickness, left ventricular outflow trace (LVOT) gradient, mitral regurgitation (MR) grade, LA dimensions, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, and tissue Doppler parameters of lateral mitral annular e' and septal mitral annular e'. The LA wall was tracked on a frame-by-frame basis using 2DSTE, and LA volume waveforms were generated. The maximum LA volume (LAV(max) ), minimal LA volume (LAV(min) ), and the LA volume before atrial contraction (LAV(pre-a) ) were measured. The LA reservoir function was calculated as the expansion index and diastolic emptying index. The LA conduit function was calculated as the passive emptying percentage of total emptying (PE) and the passive emptying index (PEI). The LA booster function was calculated as the active emptying percentage of total emptying (AE) and the active emptying index (AEI). RESULTS: The LVOT gradient, end-diastolic septal base thickness, the grade of MR, and LA end-diastolic size were significantly decreased in patients with HOCM before and 1 year after the SA (All P<.05). The lateral mitral annular e' was significantly increased (P<.05), and the E/lateral e' ratio was significantly decreased (P<.05), whereas septal mitral annular e' was significantly decreased (P<.05), and the E/septal e' ratio was significantly increased (P<.05). LAVI(max) , LAVI(min) , and LAVI(pre-a) were significantly decreased 1 year after the SA (All P<.05). The expansion and diastolic emptying indices were significantly increased (All P<.05) at 1 year after the SA. PE and PEI were significantly increased (All P<.05). The AE and AEI were significantly decreased (All P<.05). LAVI(max) , LAVI(min) , and LAVI(pre-a) of the responders group were significantly lower than those of the nonresponders group (All P<.05). The expansion and diastolic emptying indices of the responders group were significantly higher than those of the nonresponders group (All P<.05). The PE and PEI of the responders were significantly higher than those of the nonresponders group (All P<.05). The AE and AEI of the responders were significantly lower than those of the nonresponders group (All P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: We found an improvement in the LA reservoir and conduit function but a reduction in LA booster pump function 1 year after the SA in the responders."
27884247,No,Yes,No,No,Machine-Learning Algorithms to Automate Morphological and Functional Assessments in 2D Echocardiography.,"BACKGROUND: Machine-learning models may aid cardiac phenotypic recognition by using features of cardiac tissue deformation. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the diagnostic value of a machine-learning framework that incorporates speckle-tracking echocardiographic data for automated discrimination of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) from physiological hypertrophy seen in athletes (ATH). METHODS: Expert-annotated speckle-tracking echocardiographic datasets obtained from 77 ATH and 62 HCM patients were used for developing an automated system. An ensemble machine-learning model with 3 different machine-learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, and artificial neural networks) was developed and a majority voting method was used for conclusive predictions with further K-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: Feature selection using an information gain (IG) algorithm revealed that volume was the best predictor for differentiating between HCM ands. ATH (IG = 0.24) followed by mid-left ventricular segmental (IG = 0.134) and average longitudinal strain (IG = 0.131). The ensemble machine-learning model showed increased sensitivity and specificity compared with early-to-late diastolic transmitral velocity ratio (p < 0.01), average early diastolic tissue velocity (e') (p < 0.01), and strain (p = 0.04). Because ATH were younger, adjusted analysis was undertaken in younger HCM patients and compared with ATH with left ventricular wall thickness >13 mm. In this subgroup analysis, the automated model continued to show equal sensitivity, but increased specificity relative to early-to-late diastolic transmitral velocity ratio, e', and strain. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that machine-learning algorithms can assist in the discrimination of physiological versus pathological patterns of hypertrophic remodeling. This effort represents a step toward the development of a real-time, machine-learning-based system for automated interpretation of echocardiographic images, which may help novice readers with limited experience."
27532831,No,Yes,No,No,Genetic Misdiagnoses and the Potential for Health Disparities.,"BACKGROUND: For more than a decade, risk stratification for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been enhanced by targeted genetic testing. Using sequencing results, clinicians routinely assess the risk of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a patient's relatives and diagnose the condition in patients who have ambiguous clinical presentations. However, the benefits of genetic testing come with the risk that variants may be misclassified. METHODS: Using publicly accessible exome data, we identified variants that have previously been considered causal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and that are overrepresented in the general population. We studied these variants in diverse populations and reevaluated their initial ascertainments in the medical literature. We reviewed patient records at a leading genetic-testing laboratory for occurrences of these variants during the near-decade-long history of the laboratory. RESULTS: Multiple patients, all of whom were of African or unspecified ancestry, received positive reports, with variants misclassified as pathogenic on the basis of the understanding at the time of testing. Subsequently, all reported variants were recategorized as benign. The mutations that were most common in the general population were significantly more common among black Americans than among white Americans (P<0.001). Simulations showed that the inclusion of even small numbers of black Americans in control cohorts probably would have prevented these misclassifications. We identified methodologic shortcomings that contributed to these errors in the medical literature. CONCLUSIONS: The misclassification of benign variants as pathogenic that we found in our study shows the need for sequencing the genomes of diverse populations, both in asymptomatic controls and the tested patient population. These results expand on current guidelines, which recommend the use of ancestry-matched controls to interpret variants. As additional populations of different ancestry backgrounds are sequenced, we expect variant reclassifications to increase, particularly for ancestry groups that have historically been less well studied.

27318203,No,Yes,No,No,The structural effects of mutations can aid in differential phenotype prediction of beta-myosin heavy chain (Myosin-7) missense variants.,"MOTIVATION: High-throughput sequencing platforms are increasingly used to screen patients with genetic disease for pathogenic mutations, but prediction of the effects of mutations remains challenging. Previously we developed SAAPdap (Single Amino Acid Polymorphism Data Analysis Pipeline) and SAAPpred (Single Amino Acid Polymorphism Predictor) that use a combination of rule-based structural measures to predict whether a missense genetic variant is pathogenic. Here we investigate whether the same methodology can be used to develop a differential phenotype predictor, which, once a mutation has been predicted as pathogenic, is able to distinguish between phenotypes-in this case the two major clinical phenotypes (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, HCM and dilated cardiomyopathy, DCM) associated with mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) gene product (Myosin-7). RESULTS: A random forest predictor trained on rule-based structural analyses together with structural clustering data gave a Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.53 (accuracy, 75%). A post hoc removal of machine learning models that performed particularly badly, increased the performance (MCC = 0.61, Acc = 79%). This proof of concept suggests that methods used for pathogenicity prediction can be extended for use in differential phenotype prediction.

26161779,No,Yes,No,No,Global Transcriptomic Profiling of Cardiac Hypertrophy and Fatty Heart Induced by Long-Term High-Energy Diet in Bama Miniature Pigs.,"A long-term high-energy diet affects human health and leads to obesity and metabolic syndrome in addition to cardiac steatosis and hypertrophy. Ectopic fat accumulation in the heart has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for heart disorders, but the molecular mechanism of heart disease remains largely unknown. Bama miniature pigs were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) for 23 months. These pigs developed symptoms of metabolic syndrome and showed cardiac steatosis and hypertrophy with a greatly increased body weight (2.73-fold, P<0.01), insulin level (4.60-fold, P<0.01), heart weight (1.82-fold, P<0.05) and heart volume (1.60-fold, P<0.05) compared with the control pigs. To understand the molecular mechanisms of cardiac steatosis and hypertrophy, nine pig heart cRNA samples were hybridized to porcine GeneChips. Microarray analyses revealed that 1,022 genes were significantly differentially expressed (P<0.05, >/=1.5-fold change), including 591 up-regulated and 431 down-regulated genes in the HFHSD group relative to the control group. KEGG analysis indicated that the observed heart disorder involved the signal transduction-related MAPK, cytokine, and PPAR signaling pathways, energy metabolism-related fatty acid and oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathways, heart function signaling-related focal adhesion, axon guidance, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and actin cytoskeleton signaling pathways, inflammation and apoptosis pathways, and others. Quantitative RT-PCR assays identified several important differentially expressed heart-related genes, including STAT3, ACSL4, ATF4, FADD, PPP3CA, CD74, SLA-8, VCL, ACTN2 and FGFR1, which may be targets of further research. This study shows that a long-term, high-energy diet induces obesity, cardiac steatosis, and hypertrophy and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of hypertrophy and fatty heart to facilitate further research."
25253444,No,Yes,No,No,Dysregulation of genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation in abnormal cloned piglets.,"BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications (especially altered DNA methylation) resulting in altered gene expression may be one reason for development failure or abnormalities in cloned animals, but the underlying mechanism of the abnormal phenotype in cloned piglets remains unknown. Some cloned piglets in our study showed abnormal phenotypes such as large tongue (longer and thicker), weak muscles, and exomphalos. Here we conducted DNA methylation (DNAm) immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of muscle tissues of cloned piglets to investigate the relationship of abnormal DNAm with gene dysregulation and the unusual phenotypes in cloned piglets. RESULTS: Analysis of the methylomes revealed that abnormal cloned piglets suffered more hypomethylation than hypermethylation compared to the normal cloned piglets, although the DNAm level in the CpG Island was higher in the abnormal cloned piglets. Some repetitive elements, such as SINE/tRNA-Glu Satellite/centr also showed differences. We detected 1,711 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups, of which 243 genes also changed methylation level in the abnormal cloned piglets. The altered DNA methylation mainly affected the low and silently expressed genes. There were differences in both pathways and genes, such as the MAPK signalling pathway, the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathway, and the imprinted gene PLAGL1; all of which may play important roles in development of the abnormal phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The abnormal cloned piglets showed substantial changes both in the DNAm and the gene expression. Our data may provide new insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms of the reprogramming of genetic information in cloned animals."
22773159,No,Yes,No,No,Knowledge enrichment analysis for human tissue-specific genes uncover new biological insights.,"The expression and regulation of genes in different tissues are fundamental questions to be answered in biology. Knowledge enrichment analysis for tissue specific (TS) and housekeeping (HK) genes may help identify their roles in biological process or diseases and gain new biological insights. In this paper, we performed the knowledge enrichment analysis for 17,343 genes in 84 human tissues using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Hypergeometric Analysis (HA) against three biological ontologies: Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG pathways and Disease Ontology (DO) respectively. The analyses results demonstrated that the functions of most gene groups are consistent with their tissue origins. Meanwhile three interesting new associations for HK genes and the skeletal muscle tissue genes are found. Firstly, Hypergeometric analysis against KEGG database for HK genes disclosed that three disease terms (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease) are intensively enriched. Secondly, Hypergeometric analysis against the KEGG database for Skeletal Muscle tissue genes shows that two cardiac diseases of ""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)"" and ""Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)"" are heavily enriched, which are also considered as no relationship with skeletal functions. Thirdly, ""Prostate cancer"" is intensively enriched in Hypergeometric analysis against the disease ontology (DO) for the Skeletal Muscle tissue genes, which is a much unexpected phenomenon."
21802391,No,Yes,No,No,Robotic catheter ablation of left ventricular tachycardia: initial experience.,"BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) can be technically challenging due to difficulty with catheter positioning in the left ventricle (LV) and achieving stable contact. The Hansen Sensei Robotic system (HRS) has been used in atrial fibrillation but its utility in VT is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the technical feasibility of robotic catheter ablation of LV ventricular tachycardia (VT) using the HRS. METHODS: Twenty-three patients underwent LV VT mapping and ablation with the HRS via a transseptal, transmitral valve approach. Nineteen patients underwent substrate mapping and ablation (18 had ischemic cardiomyopathy, 1 had an apical variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Four patients had focal VT requiring LV VT mapping and ablation. Procedural endpoints included substrate modification by endocardial scar border ablation and elimination of late potentials, or elimination of inducible focal VT. RESULTS: Mapping and ablation were entirely robotic without requiring manual catheter manipulation in all patients and reaching all LV regions with stable contact. Fluoroscopy time of the LV procedure was 22.2 +/- 11.2 minutes. Radiofrequency time was 33 +/- 21 minutes. Total procedural times were 231 +/- 76 minutes. Complications included a left groin hematoma (opposite to the HRS sheath), 1 pericardial effusion without tamponade that was drained successfully, and transient right ventricular failure in a patient with previous left ventricular assist device. At 13.4 +/- 6.7 months of follow-up (range 1-19 months), recurrence of VT occurred in 3 of 23 patients. CONCLUSION: Our initial experience suggests that the HRS allows successful mapping and ablation of LV VT."
18238349,No,Yes,No,No,Use of neural networks in detecting cardiac diseases from echocardiographic images.,"The usefulness of backpropagation neural networks in the analysis of two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE) images has been evaluated. The gray-scale levels from 2DE images directly correspond to the intensity of echo signal from cardiac tissue, providing visual texture and allowing qualitative and quantitative analysis of myocardial tissue. A subject population consisting of 11 normal, 7 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 11 myocardial infarction patients was studied. Two types of backpropagational neural networks were used: fully connected, and patterned. In the fully connected network, the outputs of neurodes in each layer are connected to the inputs of all neurodes in the following layer. In the patterned network, only neurodes within a defined neighborhood are connected. The results suggest that the fully connected network provides better classifying performance than the patterned network."
39387793,No,Yes,No,Yes,"Prevalence, Penetrance, and Phenotypic Manifestation of Cardiomyopathy-Associated Genetic Variants in the General Population: Insights from a Mayo Clinic Biobank Study.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, penetrance, and disease expression of cardiomyopathy-related genetic variants in an unselected, richly phenotyped Mayo Clinic population in the setting of preemptive sequencing, with return of incidental findings following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed a quaternary medical center-based biobank cohort (n=983) for reportable variants in 15 cardiomyopathy genes. Prioritization of genetic variants was performed using an internally developed pipeline to identify potentially reportable variants. Prioritized variants were then manually curated. The correlation of likely pathogenic/pathogenic (LP/P) variants with clinical phenotypes and outcomes was established. Artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiographic predictions of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were applied to genotype-positive (G+) participants. RESULTS: Of the 983 patients, 11 (1%) were G+, with 11 LP/P variants found in the MYBPC3, DSG2, MYH7, DSP, and PKP2 genes. All G+ participants underwent electrocardiography, and 10 (90%) underwent echocardiography. Most patients (10 [90%]) did not have a prior diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. Definitive disease penetrance (heart failure or cardiomyopathy) was present in 4 (36%), while 3 (27%) had possible penetrance (structural heart disease identified by echocardiography). Arrhythmias and/or cardiac conduction disease was present in 4 of 11 G+ individuals (36%). Artificial intelligence-electrocardiography was positive for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in 5 of the G+ participants (45%), of whom 4 (80%) had definitive or possible disease penetrance. CONCLUSION: Cardiomyopathy-associated LP/P variants are present in a small subset of a quaternary medical center population, and disease penetrance in G+ individuals is high in the form of cardiac structural abnormalities and heart failure."
39165282,No,Yes,No,Yes,Sex-specific cardiovascular risk factors in the UK Biobank.,"The lack of sex-specific cardiovascular disease criteria contributes to the underdiagnosis of women compared to that of men. For more than half a century, the Framingham Risk Score has been the gold standard to estimate an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease based on the age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes status, and the smoking status. Now, machine learning can offer a much more nuanced insight into predicting the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The UK Biobank is a large database that includes traditional risk factors and tests related to the cardiovascular system: magnetic resonance imaging, pulse wave analysis, electrocardiograms, and carotid ultrasounds. Here, we leverage 20,542 datasets from the UK Biobank to build more accurate cardiovascular risk models than the Framingham Risk Score and quantify the underdiagnosis of women compared to that of men. Strikingly, for a first-degree atrioventricular block and dilated cardiomyopathy, two conditions with non-sex-specific diagnostic criteria, our study shows that women are under-diagnosed 2x and 1.4x more than men. Similarly, our results demonstrate the need for sex-specific criteria in essential primary hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our feature importance analysis reveals that out of the top 10 features across three sexes and four disease categories, traditional Framingham factors made up between 40% and 50%; electrocardiogram, 30%-33%; pulse wave analysis, 13%-23%; and magnetic resonance imaging and carotid ultrasound, 0%-10%. Improving the Framingham Risk Score by leveraging big data and machine learning allows us to incorporate a wider range of biomedical data and prediction features, enhance personalization and accuracy, and continuously integrate new data and knowledge, with the ultimate goal to improve accurate prediction, early detection, and early intervention in cardiovascular disease management.

38929877,No,Yes,No,Yes,Future Horizons: The Potential Role of Artificial Intelligence in Cardiology.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of premature death and disability globally, leading to significant increases in healthcare costs and economic strains. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a crucial technology in this context, promising to have a significant impact on the management of CVDs. A wide range of methods can be used to develop effective models for medical applications, encompassing everything from predicting and diagnosing diseases to determining the most suitable treatment for individual patients. This literature review synthesizes findings from multiple studies that apply AI technologies such as machine learning algorithms and neural networks to electrocardiograms, echocardiography, coronary angiography, computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A narrative review of 127 articles identified 31 papers that were directly relevant to the research, encompassing a broad spectrum of AI applications in cardiology. These applications included AI models for ECG, echocardiography, coronary angiography, computed tomography, and cardiac MRI aimed at diagnosing various cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism, and valvulopathies. The papers also explored new methods for cardiovascular risk assessment, automated measurements, and optimizing treatment strategies, demonstrating the benefits of AI technologies in cardiology. In conclusion, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in cardiology promises substantial advancements in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular diseases."
37013592,No,Yes,No,Yes,A diagnostic method for cardiomyopathy based on multimodal data.,"OBJECTIVES: Currently, a multitude of machine learning techniques are available for the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) by utilizing electrocardiography (ECG) data. However, these methods rely on digital versions of ECG data, while in practice, numerous ECG data still exist in paper form. As a result, the accuracy of the existing machine learning diagnostic models is suboptimal in practical scenarios. In order to enhance the accuracy of machine learning models for diagnosing cardiomyopathy, we propose a multimodal machine learning model capable of diagnosing both HCM and DCM. METHODS: Our study employed an artificial neural network (ANN) for feature extraction from both the echocardiogram report form and biochemical examination data. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was utilized for feature extraction from the electrocardiogram (ECG). The resulting extracted features were subsequently integrated and inputted into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for diagnostic classification. RESULTS: Our multimodal fusion model achieved a precision of 89.87%, recall of 91.20%, F1 score of 89.13%, and precision of 89.72%. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to existing machine learning models, our proposed multimodal fusion model has achieved superior results in various performance metrics. We believe that our method is effective."
36712167,No,Yes,No,Yes,Multimodal deep learning enhances diagnostic precision in left ventricular hypertrophy().,"AIMS: Determining the aetiology of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be challenging due to the similarity in clinical presentation and cardiac morphological features of diverse causes of disease. In particular, distinguishing individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) from the much larger set of individuals with manifest or occult hypertension (HTN) is of major importance for family screening and the prevention of sudden death. We hypothesized that an artificial intelligence method based joint interpretation of 12-lead electrocardiograms and echocardiogram videos could augment physician interpretation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We chose not to train on proximate data labels such as physician over-reads of ECGs or echocardiograms but instead took advantage of electronic health record derived clinical blood pressure measurements and diagnostic consensus (often including molecular testing) among physicians in an HCM centre of excellence. Using more than 18 000 combined instances of electrocardiograms and echocardiograms from 2728 patients, we developed LVH-fusion. On held-out test data, LVH-fusion achieved an F1-score of 0.71 in predicting HCM, and 0.96 in predicting HTN. In head-to-head comparison with human readers LVH-fusion had higher sensitivity and specificity rates than its human counterparts. Finally, we use explainability techniques to investigate local and global features that positively and negatively impact LVH-fusion prediction estimates providing confirmation from unsupervised analysis the diagnostic power of lateral T-wave inversion on the ECG and proximal septal hypertrophy on the echocardiogram for HCM. CONCLUSION: These results show that deep learning can provide effective physician augmentation in the face of a common diagnostic dilemma with far reaching implications for the prevention of sudden cardiac death."
36048306,No,Yes,No,Yes,Artificial Intelligence Applied to Cardiomyopathies: Is It Time for Clinical Application?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have the potential to remarkably change the practice of cardiology in order to improve and optimize outcomes in heart failure and specifically cardiomyopathies, offering us novel tools to interpret data and make clinical decisions. The aim of this review is to describe the contemporary state of AI and digital health applied to cardiomyopathies as well as to define a potential pivotal role of its application by physicians in clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Many studies have been undertaken in recent years on cardiomyopathy screening especially using AI-enhanced electrocardiography (ECG). Even with mild left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, AI-ECG screening for amyloidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or dilated cardiomyopathy is now feasible. Introduction of AI-ECG in routine clinical care has resulted in higher detection of LV systolic dysfunction; however, clinical research on a broader scale with diverse populations is necessary and ongoing. In the area of cardiac-imaging, AI automatically assesses the thickness and characteristics of myocardium to differentiate cardiomyopathies, but research on its prognostic capability has yet to be conducted. AI is also being applied to cardiomyopathy genomics, especially to predict pathogenicity of variants and identify whether these variants are clinically actionable. While the implementation of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiomyopathies is still in its infancy, an ever-growing clinical research strategy will ascertain the clinical utility of these AI tools to help improve diagnosis of and outcomes in cardiomyopathies. We also need to standardize the tools used to monitor the performance of AI-based systems which can then be used to expedite decision-making and rectify any hidden biases. Given its potential important role in clinical practice, healthcare providers need to familiarize themselves with the promise and limitations of this technology."
35551558,No,Yes,No,Yes,Deep learning-based insights on T:R ratio behaviour during prolonged screening for S-ICD eligibility.,"BACKGROUND: A major predictor of eligibility of subcutaneous implantable cardiac defibrillators (S-ICD) is the T:R ratio. The eligibility cut-off of the T:R ratio incorporates a safety margin to accommodate for fluctuations of ECG signal amplitudes. We introduce a deep learning-based tool that accurately measures the degree of T:R ratio fluctuations and explore its role in S-ICD screening. METHODS: Patients were fitted with Holters for 24 h to record their S-ICD vectors. Our tool was used to assess the T:R ratio over the duration of the recordings. Multiple T:R ratio cut-off values were applied, identifying patients at high risk of T-wave oversensing (TWO) at each of the proposed values. The purpose of our study is to identify the ratio that recognises patients at high risk of TWO while not inappropriately excluding true S-ICD candidates. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (age 54.5 + / - 21.3 years, 64.8% male) were recruited. Fourteen patients had heart-failure, 7 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 7 had normal hearts, 6 had congenital heart disease, and 3 had prior inappropriate S-ICD shocks due to TWO. 54% of patients passed the screening at a T: R of 1:3. All patients passed the screening at a T: R of 1:1. The only subgroup to wholly pass the screening utilising all the proposed ratios are the participants with normal hearts. CONCLUSION: We propose adopting prolonged screening to select patients eligible for S-ICD with low probability of TWO and inappropriate shocks. The appropriate T:R ratio likely lies between 1:3 and 1:1. Further studies are required to identify the optimal screening thresholds."

We present a case report regarding the identification of a new mutation in TNNI3 in a patient with LVNC using next-generation sequencing. A 13-year-old girl who had no family history of cardiac disease was hospitalized with dyspnea after exercise and electrocardiographic abnormalities during a school screening. Based on her clinical features, she was diagnosed with LVNC. Via genetic analysis, a TNNI3 heterozygous missense variant was identified in the proband. Although mutations in TNNI3 have been reported in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy, this is the first report of a mutation in this gene in a patient with LVNC. <Learning objective: We identified a variant in TNNI3 in a patient with isolated left ventricular noncompaction using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Mutations in TNNI3 have been reported in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The use of NGS also results in the identification of multiple genetic variants of unknown significance to the investigated disease.>."
25632790,No,Yes,No,Yes,Acute caffeine poisoning resulting in atrial fibrillation after guarana extract overdose.,"Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is the climbing vine native to Amazon Basin, characterized by high caffeine content in its seeds. Guarana extract is a common ingredient of energy drinks used in order to boost energy and physical endurance and increase alertness. Severe caffeine intoxication is rare, but may be life-threatening mostly due to supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias. OBJECTIVES: We present the case of intentional caffeine poisoning after ingestion of tablets containing guarana extract, complicated by atrial fibrillation. CASE REPORT: A44-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to hospital about 21 h after ingestion of guarana extract containing 1.6 g of caffeine. Typical symptoms of caffeine toxicity, i.e. nausea, vomiting, anxiety and palpitaions, occurred shortly after ingestion. On admission, he was conscious, with blood pressure of 136/86 mmHg, heart rate of 106-113 beats per minute, fever of 37.8  degrees C, and symmetrically increased deep tendon reflexes. QTc interval in electrocardiogram was prolonged to 0.542 s. Laboratory tests revealed hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, as well as elevated creatinine and creatine phosphokinase levels. Approximately 45 h post ingestion, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with fast ventricular rhythm. Tachydysrythmia subsided after infusion of amiodarone and restoration of electrolyte balance. Echocardiogram revealed presence of asymmetrical hypertrophy of the left ventricle with the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and normal left ventricular outflow tract gradient suggesting non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSION: Acute caffeine poisoning may result in atrial fibrillation, especially in predisposed patients with underlying hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
3841912,No,Yes,No,Yes,[Pulsed Doppler evaluation of left ventricular pressure and pressure difference in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy].,"To assess the patho-physiological severity of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), the systolic pressure differences caused by the functional stenosis across the outflow tract of the left ventricle must be evaluated. The present study explored and proposed a non-invasive method predicting the pressure difference across the intraventricular obstruction and the pressure proximal to the obstruction by using pulsed Doppler technique, guided by simultaneous two-dimensional echocardiography. The ultrasonic equipment recently developed in our laboratory was used. It consisted of a 3.0 MHz pulsed ultrasonic transducer with a 4.4 KHz repetition rate and a mechanical sector scanner equipped with a single concave transducer 1.3 cm in diameter having a 70 mm radius of curvature. The sample volume was approximately 3 X 3 X 3 mm. Doppler signals obtained were subjected to a real-time analyzer with a fast Fourier transformer, and were simultaneously recorded on a thermal recorder as a spectral display together with an M-mode echocardiogram, lead II ECG, phonocardiogram and mechanocardiogram. Ten adults with HOCM were the subjects in the present study. For six of the 10, good pressure tracings were obtained. The pressure differences estimated by the maximum velocity as measured from the Doppler signals at the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract and the pressure gradients as obtained by cardiac catheterization were subjected to correlative analysis. Prior to investigating the pressure differences, the site and mechanism of the outflow obstruction in HOCM were studied in two cases using two-dimensional echocardiography in the longitudinal- and short-axis views. The obstruction was produced during systole by posteroinferior displacement of the hypertrophied interventricular septum and by abnormal anterosuperior movement of the hypertrophied, and elongated anterior or posterior papillary muscles. Thus, a concentric and centripetal narrowing was formed at the midportion of the outflow tract. In some cases, a bottle-shaped chamber was clearly observed in the apical area. Ultrasonic Doppler examinations were performed by the apical approach. Flow velocity patterns in the apical region or proximal to the obstruction had two peaks with a narrow spectrum in systole. At the distal portion or downstream the obstruction had a pattern with a narrow spectrum and a sharp single peak. To measure the maximum flow velocity, Doppler velocity patterns recorded immediately distal to the obstruction were used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
39317305,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,"An analysis regarding the article ""Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram for the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis: A systemic review and meta-analysis"".","Cardiac Amyloidosis (CA) occurs when misfolded proteins accumulate in the heart muscle, leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy and possibly escalating to heart failure, impaired conduction system function, and sudden cardiac arrest. It is a significant clinical challenge due to its high rates of underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. Research indicates that about 35% of individuals with CA have been incorrectly diagnosed with other prevalent cardiovascular diseases. CA is differentiated into various subtypes depending on the protein involved in its pathogenesis, with Transthyretin Amyloidosis (ATTR) and Light Chain Amyloidosis (AL) being the most common. A key diagnostic challenge is the subtle clinical presentation of CA, which often resembles other heart conditions such as restrictive cardiomyopathy with left ventricular hypertrophy or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). While several diagnostic methods are available for CA, many are expensive, invasive, and typically used after an initial clinical suspicion. Non-invasive tests like electrocardiography (ECG) are accessible but often have lower sensitivity in detecting CA. Given the limited expertise in recognizing CA symptoms in primary care settings, there is an urgent need for systems that can aid in early detection. It is crucial to develop systems that equip primary care providers with the tools and knowledge to recognize the subtle signs of cardiac amyloidosis, thereby enhancing patient outcomes."

This article aims to provide a basic understanding of AI enabled ECG technology. Specific conditions and findings will be discussed, followed by reviewing associated terminology and methodology. In the appendix, definitions of AUC versus accuracy are explained. The application of deep learning models enables detecting diseases from normal electrocardiograms at accuracy not previously achieved by technology or human experts. Results with AI enabled ECG are encouraging as they considerably exceeded current screening models for specific conditions (i.e., atrial fibrillation, left ventricular dysfunction, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). This could potentially lead to a revitalization of the utilization of the ECG in the insurance domain. While we are embracing the findings with this rapidly evolving technology, but cautious optimism is still necessary at this point."

38762623,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Development and validation of machine learning algorithms based on electrocardiograms for cardiovascular diagnoses at the population level.,"Artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithms are gaining prominence for the early detection of cardiovascular (CV) conditions, including those not traditionally associated with conventional ECG measures or expert interpretation. This study develops and validates such models for simultaneous prediction of 15 different common CV diagnoses at the population level. We conducted a retrospective study that included 1,605,268 ECGs of 244,077 adult patients presenting to 84 emergency departments or hospitals, who underwent at least one 12-lead ECG from February 2007 to April 2020 in Alberta, Canada, and considered 15 CV diagnoses, as identified by International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes: atrial fibrillation (AF), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), ventricular tachycardia (VT), cardiac arrest (CA), atrioventricular block (AVB), unstable angina (UA), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), pulmonary embolism (PE), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), aortic stenosis (AS), mitral valve prolapse (MVP), mitral valve stenosis (MS), pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), and heart failure (HF). We employed ResNet-based deep learning (DL) using ECG tracings and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) using ECG measurements. When evaluated on the first ECGs per episode of 97,631 holdout patients, the DL models had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of <80% for 3 CV conditions (PTE, SVT, UA), 80-90% for 8 CV conditions (CA, NSTEMI, VT, MVP, PHTN, AS, AF, HF) and an AUROC > 90% for 4 diagnoses (AVB, HCM, MS, STEMI). DL models outperformed XGB models with about 5% higher AUROC on average. Overall, ECG-based prediction models demonstrated good-to-excellent prediction performance in diagnosing common CV conditions."
38753291,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Artificial Intelligence Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram: A State-of-the-Art Review.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming electrocardiography (ECG) interpretation. AI diagnostics can reach beyond human capabilities, facilitate automated access to nuanced ECG interpretation, and expand the scope of cardiovascular screening in the population. AI can be applied to the standard 12-lead resting ECG and single-lead ECGs in external monitors, implantable devices, and direct-to-consumer smart devices. We summarize the current state of the literature on AI-ECG. RECENT FINDINGS: Rhythm classification was the first application of AI-ECG. Subsequently, AI-ECG models have been developed for screening structural heart disease including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Further, AI models can predict future events like development of systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. AI-ECG exhibits potential in acute cardiac events and non-cardiac applications, including acute pulmonary embolism, electrolyte abnormalities, monitoring drugs therapy, sleep apnea, and predicting all-cause mortality. Many AI models in the domain of cardiac monitors and smart watches have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for rhythm classification, while others for identification of cardiac amyloidosis, pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction have received breakthrough device designation. As AI-ECG models continue to be developed, in addition to regulatory oversight and monetization challenges, thoughtful clinical implementation to streamline workflows, avoiding information overload and overwhelming of healthcare systems with false positive results is necessary. Research to demonstrate and validate improvement in healthcare efficiency and improved patient outcomes would be required before widespread adoption of any AI-ECG model."

This study aims to evaluate the predictive power of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled analysis of preoperative electrocardiograms (ECGs) in forecasting long-term mortality following KT. METHODS: We analyzed preoperative ECGs from KT recipients at three Mayo Clinic sites (Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona) between January 1, 2006, and July 30, 2021. The study involved 6 validated AI algorithms, each trained to predict future development of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, low ejection fraction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, amyloid heart disease, and biological age. These algorithms' outputs based on a single preoperative ECG were correlated with patient mortality data. RESULTS: Among 6504 KT recipients included in the study, 1764 (27.1%) died within a median follow-up of 5.7 y (interquartile range: 3.00-9.29 y). All AI-ECG algorithms were independently associated with long-term all-cause mortality ( P < 0.001). Notably, few patients had a clinical cardiac diagnosis at the time of transplant, indicating that AI-ECG scores were predictive even in asymptomatic patients. When adjusted for multiple clinical factors such as recipient age, diabetes, and pretransplant dialysis, AI algorithms for atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis remained independently associated with long-term mortality. These algorithms also improved the C-statistic for predicting overall (C = 0.74) and cardiac-related deaths (C = 0.751). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that AI-enabled preoperative ECG analysis can be a valuable tool in predicting long-term mortality following KT and could aid in identifying patients who may benefit from enhanced cardiac monitoring because of increased risk."
38398346,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,An Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Electrocardiograms for the Clinical Diagnosis of Cardiovascular Diseases: A Narrative Review.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to cardiovascular disease (CVD) is enjoying great success in the field of scientific research. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the cornerstone form of examination in cardiology and are the most widely used diagnostic tool because they are widely available, inexpensive, and fast. Applications of AI to ECGs, especially deep learning (DL) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been developed in many fields of cardiology in recent years. Deep learning methods provide valuable support for rapid ECG interpretation, demonstrating a diagnostic capability overlapping with specialists in the diagnosis of CVD by a classical analysis of macroscopic changes in the ECG trace. Through photoplethysmography, wearable devices can obtain single-derivative ECGs for the recognition of AI-diagnosed arrhythmias. In addition, CNNs have been developed that recognize no macroscopic electrocardiographic changes and can predict, from a 12-lead ECG, atrial fibrillation, even from sinus rhythm; left and right ventricular function; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; acute coronary syndromes; or aortic stenosis. The fields of application are many, but numerous are the limitations, mainly associated with the reliability of the acquired data, an inability to verify black box processes, and medico-legal and ethical problems. The challenge of modern medicine is to recognize the limitations of AI and overcome them."
37280346,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,A foundational vision transformer improves diagnostic performance for electrocardiograms.,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a ubiquitous diagnostic modality. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied towards ECG analysis require large sample sizes, and transfer learning approaches for biomedical problems may result in suboptimal performance when pre-training is done on natural images. We leveraged masked image modeling to create a vision-based transformer model, HeartBEiT, for electrocardiogram waveform analysis. We pre-trained this model on 8.5 million ECGs and then compared performance vs. standard CNN architectures for diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, low left ventricular ejection fraction and ST elevation myocardial infarction using differing training sample sizes and independent validation datasets. We find that HeartBEiT has significantly higher performance at lower sample sizes compared to other models. We also find that HeartBEiT improves explainability of diagnosis by highlighting biologically relevant regions of the EKG vs. standard CNNs. Domain specific pre-trained transformer models may exceed the classification performance of models trained on natural images especially in very low data regimes. The combination of the architecture and such pre-training allows for more accurate, granular explainability of model predictions."
37101945,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Artificial intelligence-enabled classification of hypertrophic heart diseases using electrocardiograms.,"BACKGROUND: Differentiating among cardiac diseases associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) informs diagnosis and clinical care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if artificial intelligence-enabled analysis of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) facilitates automated detection and classification of LVH. METHODS: We used a pretrained convolutional neural network to derive numerical representations of 12-lead ECG waveforms from patients in a multi-institutional healthcare system who had cardiac diseases associated with LVH (n = 50,709), including cardiac amyloidosis (n = 304), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 1056), hypertension (n = 20,802), aortic stenosis (n = 446), and other causes (n = 4766). We then regressed LVH etiologies relative to no LVH on age, sex, and the numerical 12-lead representations using logistic regression (""LVH-Net""). To assess deep learning model performance on single-lead data analogous to mobile ECGs, we also developed 2 single-lead deep learning models by training models on lead I (""LVH-Net Lead I"") or lead II (""LVH-Net Lead II"") from the 12-lead ECG. We compared the performance of the LVH-Net models to alternative models fit on (1) age, sex, and standard ECG measures, and (2) clinical ECG-based rules for diagnosing LVH. RESULTS: The areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve of LVH-Net by specific LVH etiology were cardiac amyloidosis 0.95 [95% CI, 0.93-0.97], hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 0.92 [95% CI, 0.90-0.94], aortic stenosis LVH 0.90 [95% CI, 0.88-0.92], hypertensive LVH 0.76 [95% CI, 0.76-0.77], and other LVH 0.69 [95% CI 0.68-0.71]. The single-lead models also discriminated LVH etiologies well. CONCLUSION: An artificial intelligence-enabled ECG model is favorable for detection and classification of LVH and outperforms clinical ECG-based rules."
33526938,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography in cardiovascular disease management.,"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the electrocardiogram (ECG), a ubiquitous and standardized test, is an example of the ongoing transformative effect of AI on cardiovascular medicine. Although the ECG has long offered valuable insights into cardiac and non-cardiac health and disease, its interpretation requires considerable human expertise. Advanced AI methods, such as deep-learning convolutional neural networks, have enabled rapid, human-like interpretation of the ECG, while signals and patterns largely unrecognizable to human interpreters can be detected by multilayer AI networks with precision, making the ECG a powerful, non-invasive biomarker. Large sets of digital ECGs linked to rich clinical data have been used to develop AI models for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, silent (previously undocumented and asymptomatic) atrial fibrillation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as the determination of a person's age, sex and race, among other phenotypes. The clinical and population-level implications of AI-based ECG phenotyping continue to emerge, particularly with the rapid rise in the availability of mobile and wearable ECG technologies. In this Review, we summarize the current and future state of the AI-enhanced ECG in the detection of cardiovascular disease in at-risk populations, discuss its implications for clinical decision-making in patients with cardiovascular disease and critically appraise potential limitations and unknowns."
31525078,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Automated and Interpretable Patient ECG Profiles for Disease Detection, Tracking, and Discovery.","BACKGROUND: The ECG remains the most widely used diagnostic test for characterization of cardiac structure and electrical activity. We hypothesized that parallel advances in computing power, machine learning algorithms, and availability of large-scale data could substantially expand the clinical inferences derived from the ECG while at the same time preserving interpretability for medical decision-making. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 36 186 ECGs from the University of California, San Francisco database that would enable training of models for estimation of cardiac structure or function or detection of disease. We segmented the ECG into standard component waveforms and intervals using a novel combination of convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models and evaluated this segmentation by comparing resulting electrical intervals against 141 864 measurements produced during the clinical workflow. We then built a patient-level ECG profile, a 725-element feature vector and used this profile to train and interpret machine learning models for examples of cardiac structure (left ventricular mass, left atrial volume, and mitral annulus e-prime) and disease (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and mitral valve prolapse). ECG measurements derived from the convolutional neural network-hidden Markov model segmentation agreed with clinical estimates, with median absolute deviations as a fraction of observed value of 0.6% for heart rate and 4% for QT interval. Models trained using patient-level ECG profiles enabled surprising quantitative estimates of left ventricular mass and mitral annulus e' velocity (median absolute deviation of 16% and 19%, respectively) with good discrimination for left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction as binary traits. Model performance using our approach for disease detection demonstrated areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 for pulmonary arterial hypertension, 0.91 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 0.86 for cardiac amyloid, and 0.77 for mitral valve prolapse. CONCLUSIONS: Modern machine learning methods can extend the 12-lead ECG to quantitative applications well beyond its current uses while preserving the transparency that is so fundamental to clinical care."
29852956,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Automated characterization of cardiovascular diseases using relative wavelet nonlinear features extracted from ECG signals.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of deaths worldwide. The rising mortality rate can be reduced by early detection and treatment interventions. Clinically, electrocardiogram (ECG) signal provides useful information about the cardiac abnormalities and hence employed as a diagnostic modality for the detection of various CVDs. However, subtle changes in these time series indicate a particular disease. Therefore, it may be monotonous, time-consuming and stressful to inspect these ECG beats manually. In order to overcome this limitation of manual ECG signal analysis, this paper uses a novel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method combined with nonlinear features for automated characterization of CVDs. ECG signals of normal, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and myocardial infarction (MI) are subjected to five levels of DWT. Relative wavelet of four nonlinear features such as fuzzy entropy, sample entropy, fractal dimension and signal energy are extracted from the DWT coefficients. These features are fed to sequential forward selection (SFS) technique and then ranked using ReliefF method. Our proposed methodology achieved maximum classification accuracy (acc) of 99.27%, sensitivity (sen) of 99.74%, and specificity (spec) of 98.08% with K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier using 15 features ranked by the ReliefF method. Our proposed methodology can be used by clinical staff to make faster and accurate diagnosis of CVDs. Thus, the chances of survival can be significantly increased by early detection and treatment of CVDs."
22327231,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death of the young athlete: the controversy about the screening electrocardiogram and its innovative artificial intelligence solution.,"The preparticipation screening for athlete participation in sports typically entails a comprehensive medical and family history and a complete physical examination. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can increase the likelihood of detecting cardiac diagnoses such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but this diagnostic test as part of the screening process has engendered considerable controversy. The pro position is supported by argument that international screening protocols support its use, positive diagnosis has multiple benefits, history and physical examination are inadequate, primary prevention is essential, and the cost effectiveness is justified. Although the aforementioned myriad of justifications for routine ECG screening of young athletes can be persuasive, several valid contentions oppose supporting such a policy, namely, that the sudden death incidence is very (too) low, the ECG screening will be too costly, the false-positive rate is too high, resources will be allocated away from other diseases, and manpower is insufficient for its execution. Clinicians, including pediatric cardiologists, have an understandable proclivity for avoiding this prodigious national endeavor. The controversy, however, should not be focused on whether an inexpensive, noninvasive test such as an ECG should be mandated but should instead be directed at just how these tests for young athletes can be performed in the clinical imbroglio of these disease states (with variable genetic penetrance and phenotypic expression) with concomitant fiscal accountability and logistical expediency in this era of economic restraint. This monumental endeavor in any city or region requires two crucial elements well known to business scholars: implementation and execution. The eventual solution for the screening ECG dilemma requires a truly innovative and systematic approach that will liberate us from inadequate conventional solutions. Artificial intelligence, specifically the process termed ""machine learning"" and ""neural networking,"" involves complex algorithms that allow computers to improve the decision-making process based on repeated input of empirical data (e.g., databases and ECGs). These elements all can be improved with a national database, evidence-based medicine, and in the near future, innovation that entails a Kurzweilian artificial intelligence infrastructure with machine learning and neural networking that will construct the ultimate clinical decision-making algorithm."
39812845,No,No,No,No,Clinical and imaging spectrum of non-congenital dominant ACTN2 myopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Alpha-actinin-2, a protein with high expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle, is located in the Z-disc and plays a key role in sarcomere stability. Mutations in ACTN2 have been associated with both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy and, more recently, with skeletal myopathy. METHODS: Genetic, clinical, and muscle imaging data were collected from 37 patients with an autosomal dominant ACTN2 myopathy belonging to 11 families from Spain and Belgium. Haplotypes were studied to confirm a common ancestry for the two most common recurrent variants identified in this study. A trained machine learning model was used to compare muscle MRI scans in ACTN2 myopathy with other neuromuscular diseases to identify a specific pattern of muscle involvement. RESULTS: The clinical phenotype ranged from asymptomatic to limb-girdle weakness and facial involvement and was depending on genotype. Cardiac and respiratory involvement were not common. Belgian families carrying the p.Ile134Asn variant and Basque-Spanish families carrying the p.Cys487Arg variant each showed unique haplotypes supporting respective common ancestry. Available muscle biopsies showed non-specific changes. In muscle imaging, the most affected muscles were the glutei minor, glutei medius, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and soleus. A machine learning model showed that the most differentiating features in dominant ACTN2 myopathy were the involvement of the tibialis anterior and gluteus medius muscles and preservation of the quadratus femoris, gastrocnemius lateralis, and tensor fasciae latae muscles. CONCLUSION: We provide new insights into genetic, clinical, and muscle imaging characteristics of non-congenital dominant ACTN2 myopathy, broadening the phenotypic spectrum of muscle disorders caused by ACTN2 variants."
39797879,No,No,No,No,"The Last Decade in Cardiac Amyloidosis: Advances in Understanding Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and Quantification, Prognosis, Treatment Strategies, and Monitoring Response.","Cardiac amyloidosis represents a unique disease process characterized by amyloid fibril deposition within the myocardial extracellular space. Advances in multimodality cardiac imaging enable accurate diagnosis and facilitate prompt initiation of disease-modifying therapies. Furthermore, rapid advances in multimodality imaging have enriched understanding of the underlying pathogenesis, enhanced prognostication, and resulted in the development of imaging-based markers that reflect the amyloid burden, which is of increasing importance when assessing the response to treatment. Whereas conventional therapies have focused on reducing amyloid formation and subsequent stabilization of the cardiac disease process, novel agents are being developed to accelerate the immune-mediated removal of amyloid fibrils from the heart. In this context, the ability to track changes in the amyloid burden over time is of paramount importance. Although advanced imaging techniques have shown efficacy in tracking the treatment response, future research focused on improved precision through use of artificial intelligence may augment the detection of changes earlier in the course of treatment."
39318696,No,No,No,No,Clinical and genetic associations of asymmetric apical and septal left ventricular hypertrophy.,"AIMS: Increased left ventricular mass has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes including incident cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Such associations have been studied in relation to total left ventricular hypertrophy, while the regional distribution of myocardial hypertrophy is extremely variable. The clinically significant and genetic associations of such variability require further study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we use deep learning-derived phenotypes of disproportionate patterns of hypertrophy, namely, apical and septal hypertrophy, to study genome-wide and clinical associations in addition to and independent from total left ventricular mass within 35 268 UK Biobank participants. Using polygenic risk score and Cox regression, we quantified the relationship between incident cardiovascular outcomes and genetically determined phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Adjusting for total left ventricular mass, apical hypertrophy is associated with elevated risk for cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Cardiomyopathy risk was increased for subjects with increased apical or septal mass, even in the absence of global hypertrophy. We identified 17 genome-wide associations for left ventricular mass, 3 unique associations with increased apical mass, and 3 additional unique associations with increased septal mass. An elevated polygenic risk score for apical mass corresponded with an increased risk of cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. CONCLUSION: Apical and septal mass may be driven by genes distinct from total left ventricular mass, suggesting unique genetic profiles for patterns of hypertrophy. Focal hypertrophy confers independent and additive risk to incident cardiovascular disease. Our findings emphasize the significance of characterizing distinct subtypes of left ventricular hypertrophy. Further studies are needed in multi-ethnic cohorts."

METHODS: The National Institutes of Health-funded LIVE-LQTS study (Lifestyle and Exercise in the Long QT Syndrome) prospectively enrolled individuals 8 to 60 years of age with phenotypic and/or genotypic LQTS from 37 sites in 5 countries from May 2015 to February 2019. Participants (or parents) answered physical activity and clinical events surveys every 6 months for 3 years with follow-up completed in February 2022. Vigorous exercise was defined as >/=6 metabolic equivalents for >60 hours per year. A blinded Clinical Events Committee adjudicated the composite end point of sudden death, sudden cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmia treated by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, and likely arrhythmic syncope. A National Death Index search ascertained vital status for those with incomplete follow-up. A noninferiority hypothesis (boundary of 1.5) between vigorous exercisers and others was tested with multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 1413 participants (13% <18 years of age, 35% 18-25 years of age, 67% female, 25% with implantable cardioverter defibrillators, 90% genotype positive, 49% with LQT1, 91% were treated with beta-blockers, left cardiac sympathetic denervation, and/or implantable cardioverter defibrillator), 52% participated in vigorous exercise (55% of these competitively). Thirty-seven individuals experienced the composite end point (including one sudden cardiac arrest and one sudden death in the nonvigorous group, one sudden cardiac arrest in the vigorous group) with overall event rates at 3 years of 2.6% in the vigorous and 2.7% in the nonvigorous exercise groups. The unadjusted hazard ratio for experience of events for the vigorous group compared with the nonvigorous group was 0.97 (90% CI, 0.57-1.67), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.17 (90% CI, 0.67-2.04). The upper 95% one-sided confidence level extended beyond the 1.5 boundary. Neither vigorous or nonvigorous exercise was found to be superior in any group or subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals diagnosed with phenotypic and/or genotypic LQTS who were risk assessed and treated in experienced centers, LQTS-associated cardiac event rates were low and similar between those exercising vigorously and those not exercising vigorously. Consistent with the low event rate, CIs are wide, and noninferiority was not demonstrated. These data further inform shared decision-making discussions between patient and physician about exercise and competitive sports participation.

38961143,No,No,No,No,Identification of hub genes associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy using integrated bioinformatics analysis.,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common cardiovascular complication of diabetes, which may threaten the quality of life and shorten life expectancy in the diabetic population. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the diabetes cardiomyopathy are not fully elucidated. We analyzed two datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to screen key genes and molecules. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were constructed to identify hub genes. The diagnostic value of the hub gene was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to validate the hub genes. A total of 13 differentially co-expressed modules were selected by WGCNA and differential expression analysis. KEGG and GO analysis showed these DEGs were mainly enriched in lipid metabolism and myocardial hypertrophy pathway, cytomembrane, and mitochondrion. As a result, six genes were identified as hub genes. Finally, five genes (Pdk4, Lipe, Serpine1, Igf1r, and Bcl2l1) were found significantly changed in both the validation dataset and experimental mice with DCM. In conclusion, the present study identified five genes that may help provide novel targets for diagnosing and treating DCM."
38867869,No,No,No,No,The new 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies: a guiding path for cardiologist decisions.,"In the ESC 2023 guidelines, cardiomyopathies are conservatively defined as 'myocardial disorders in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease, and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality'. They are morpho-functionally classified as hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy with the addition of the left ventricular non-dilated cardiomyopathy that describes intermediate phenotypes not fulfilling standard disease definitions despite the presence of myocardial disease on cardiac imaging or tissue analysis. The new ESC guidelines provide 'a guide to the diagnostic approach to cardiomyopathies, highlight general evaluation and management issues, and signpost the reader to the relevant evidence base for the recommendations'. The recommendations and suggestions included in the document provide the tools to build up pathways tailored to specific cardiomyopathy (phenotype and cause) and define therapeutic indications, including target therapies where possible. The impact is on clinical cardiology, where disease-specific care paths can be assisted by the guidelines, and on genetics, both clinics and testing, where deep phenotyping and participated multi-disciplinary evaluation provide a unique tool for validating the pathogenicity of variants. The role of endomyocardial biopsy remains underexploited and confined to particular forms of restrictive cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and amyloidosis. New research and development will be needed to cover the gaps between science and clinics. Finally, the opening up to disciplines such as bioinformatics, bioengineering, mathematics, and physics will support clinical cardiologists in the best governance of the novel artificial intelligence-assisted resources."

The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) in healthcare necessitates a comprehensive review to evaluate these developments and their potential to enhance HF evaluation, aligning clinical practices with technological advancements. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to systematically explore the contributions of DL technologies in the assessment of HF, focusing on their potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, personalize treatment strategies, and address the impact of comorbidities. METHODS: A thorough literature search was conducted across four major electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore, yielding 137 articles that were subsequently categorized into five primary application areas: cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification, HF detection, image analysis, risk assessment, and other clinical analyses. The selection criteria focused on studies utilizing DL algorithms for HF assessment, not limited to HF detection but extending to any attempt in analyzing and interpreting HF-related data. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a notable emphasis on CVD classification and HF detection, with DL algorithms showing significant promise in distinguishing between affected individuals and healthy subjects. Furthermore, the review highlights DL's capacity to identify underlying cardiomyopathies and other comorbidities, underscoring its utility in refining diagnostic processes and tailoring treatment plans to individual patient needs. CONCLUSIONS: This review establishes DL as a key innovation in HF management, highlighting its role in advancing diagnostic accuracy and personalized care. The insights provided advocate for the integration of DL in clinical settings and suggest directions for future research to enhance patient outcomes in HF care."
38402924,No,No,No,No,Comparative Evaluation of Alcohol Septal Ablation: Left Anterior Descending Versus Non-left Anterior Descending Artery Approaches.,"Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is performed for symptomatic drug-refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy to reduce the left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient (LVOTPG) by injecting ethanol into a septal branch that perforates the septal bulge. The target septal branches usually arise directly from the left anterior descending (LAD) artery; however, vessels from a non-LAD artery can be selected in some cases. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety between ASA performed using a septal branch arising from a non-LAD artery and a branch arising from the LAD artery. This single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study comprised patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy who underwent ASA at the Gifu Heart Centre between 2011 and 2022. The effectiveness and safety of ASA using the 2 artery types were compared. The primary end points were LVOTPG and procedure success, determined as LVOTPG <30 mm Hg after 1 year. Of 33 patients (mean age 66.4 +/- 13.0 years, 13 men), 18 patients who underwent ASA using only LAD branches and 15 patients who underwent ASA using only non-LAD branches demonstrated no significant difference in the decrease in LVOTPG during the follow-up period (-99.1 +/- 47.4 mm Hg/year vs -75.7 +/- 39.2 mm Hg/year, respectively, p = 0.19). The procedure success at 1 year was not significantly different between the 2 groups (93.3% and 84.6%, respectively, p = 0.58). ASA performed using septal branches from non-LAD arteries could be an alternative treatment approach when appropriate septal branches are missing or desirable effects cannot be obtained from ASA using LAD branches."
37623681,No,No,No,No,Prospective of Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis Using Cardiac Sensing.,"Pancreatic carcinoma (Ca Pancreas) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. The malignancies of the pancreas can be diagnosed with the help of various imaging modalities. An endoscopic ultrasound with a tissue biopsy is so far considered to be the gold standard in terms of the detection of Ca Pancreas, especially for lesions <2 mm. However, other methods, like computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are also conventionally used. Moreover, newer techniques, like proteomics, radiomics, metabolomics, and artificial intelligence (AI), are slowly being introduced for diagnosing pancreatic cancer. Regardless, it is still a challenge to diagnose pancreatic carcinoma non-invasively at an early stage due to its delayed presentation. Similarly, this also makes it difficult to demonstrate an association between Ca Pancreas and other vital organs of the body, such as the heart. A number of studies have proven a correlation between the heart and pancreatic cancer. The tumor of the pancreas affects the heart at the physiological, as well as the molecular, level. An overexpression of the SMAD4 gene; a disruption in biomolecules, such as IGF, MAPK, and ApoE; and increased CA19-9 markers are a few of the many factors that are noted to affect cardiovascular systems with pancreatic malignancies. A comprehensive review of this correlation will aid researchers in conducting studies to help establish a definite relation between the two organs and discover ways to use it for the early detection of Ca Pancreas."
37474391,No,No,No,No,Development and validation of machine learning algorithms to predict posthypertensive origin in left ventricular hypertrophy.,"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy is often associated with hypertension, which is not necessarily the cause of hypertrophy. Non-hypertension-related aetiologies often have a strong impact on patient management, and therefore require a thorough and careful workup. When considering all left ventricular hypertrophies, even the mild ones, the number of patients who need a workup increases drastically. This raises the need for a tool to evaluate the pretest probability of the origin of left ventricular hypertrophy. AIM: To predict the hypertensive origin of left ventricular hypertrophy using machine learning on first-line clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic variables. METHODS: We used a retrospective single-centre population of 591 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, starting at 12mm maximal left ventricular wall thickness. After splitting data in a training and testing set, we trained three different algorithms: decision tree; random forest; and support vector machine. Model performances were validated on the testing set. RESULTS: All models exhibited good areas under receiver operating characteristic curves: 0.82 (95% confidence interval: 0.77-0.88) for the decision tree; 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.85-0.94) for the random forest; and 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 0.85-0.94) for the support vector machine. After threshold selection, the last model had the best balance between its specificity of 0.96 (95% confidence interval: 0.91-0.99) and its sensitivity of 0.31 (95% confidence interval: 0.17-0.44). All algorithms relied on similar most influential predictor variables. Online calculators were developed and made publicly available. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models were able to determine the hypertensive origin of left ventricular hypertrophy with good performances. Implementation in clinical practice could reduce the number of aetiological workups needed in patients presenting with left ventricular hypertrophy."

Life-threatening arrhythmias, which underlie sudden cardiac death, can be triggered by high-intensity exercise. It raises the question whether, and if so, how athletes should be screened for cardiomyopathies. The example of practice from Italy is discussed. We also briefly discuss novel developments, such as wearable biosensors and machine learning, which could be applied to screening for cardiomyopathies in future."
37081215,No,No,No,No,Genetics of myocardial interstitial fibrosis in the human heart and association with disease.,"Myocardial interstitial fibrosis is associated with cardiovascular disease and adverse prognosis. Here, to investigate the biological pathways that underlie fibrosis in the human heart, we developed a machine learning model to measure native myocardial T1 time, a marker of myocardial fibrosis, in 41,505 UK Biobank participants who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Greater T1 time was associated with diabetes mellitus, renal disease, aortic stenosis, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, conduction disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Genome-wide association analysis identified 11 independent loci associated with T1 time. The identified loci implicated genes involved in glucose transport (SLC2A12), iron homeostasis (HFE, TMPRSS6), tissue repair (ADAMTSL1, VEGFC), oxidative stress (SOD2), cardiac hypertrophy (MYH7B) and calcium signaling (CAMK2D). Using a transforming growth factor beta1-mediated cardiac fibroblast activation assay, we found that 9 of the 11 loci consisted of genes that exhibited temporal changes in expression or open chromatin conformation supporting their biological relevance to myofibroblast cell state acquisition. By harnessing machine learning to perform large-scale quantification of myocardial interstitial fibrosis using cardiac imaging, we validate associations between cardiac fibrosis and disease, and identify new biologically relevant pathways underlying fibrosis."
36991474,No,No,No,No,Automated segmentation of long and short axis DENSE cardiovascular magnetic resonance for myocardial strain analysis using spatio-temporal convolutional neural networks.,"BACKGROUND: Cine Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) facilitates the quantification of myocardial deformation, by encoding tissue displacements in the cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) image phase, from which myocardial strain can be estimated with high accuracy and reproducibility. Current methods for analyzing DENSE images still heavily rely on user input, making this process time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. The present study sought to develop a spatio-temporal deep learning model for segmentation of the left-ventricular (LV) myocardium, as spatial networks often fail due to contrast-related properties of DENSE images. METHODS: 2D + time nnU-Net-based models have been trained to segment the LV myocardium from DENSE magnitude data in short- and long-axis images. A dataset of 360 short-axis and 124 long-axis slices was used to train the networks, from a combination of healthy subjects and patients with various conditions (hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, myocarditis). Segmentation performance was evaluated using ground-truth manual labels, and a strain analysis using conventional methods was performed to assess strain agreement with manual segmentation. Additional validation was performed using an externally acquired dataset to compare the inter- and intra-scanner reproducibility with respect to conventional methods. RESULTS: Spatio-temporal models gave consistent segmentation performance throughout the cine sequence, while 2D architectures often failed to segment end-diastolic frames due to the limited blood-to-myocardium contrast. Our models achieved a DICE score of 0.83 +/- 0.05 and a Hausdorff distance of 4.0 +/- 1.1 mm for short-axis segmentation, and 0.82 +/- 0.03 and 7.9 +/- 3.9 mm respectively for long-axis segmentations. Strain measurements obtained from automatically estimated myocardial contours showed good to excellent agreement with manual pipelines, and remained within the limits of inter-user variability estimated in previous studies. CONCLUSION: Spatio-temporal deep learning shows increased robustness for the segmentation of cine DENSE images. It provides excellent agreement with manual segmentation for strain extraction. Deep learning will facilitate the analysis of DENSE data, bringing it one step closer to clinical routine."

36386347,No,No,No,No,Using machine learning to find genes associated with sudden death.,"OBJECTIVE: To search for significant biomarkers associated with sudden death (SD). METHODS: Differential genes were screened by comparing the whole blood samples from 15 cases of accidental death (AD) and 88 cases of SD. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network selects core genes that interact most frequently. Machine learning is applied to find characteristic genes related to SD. The CIBERSORT method was used to explore the immune-microenvironment changes. RESULTS: A total of 10 core genes (MYL1, TNNC2, TNNT3, TCAP, TNNC1, TPM2, MYL2, TNNI1, ACTA1, CKM) were obtained and they were mainly related to myocarditis, hypertrophic myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Characteristic genes of MYL2 and TNNT3 associated with SD were established by machine learning. There was no significant change in the immune-microenvironment before and after SD. CONCLUSION: Detecting characteristic genes is helpful to identify patients at high risk of SD and speculate the cause of death."
35956022,No,No,No,No,The Impact of Mental Stress on Cardiovascular Health-Part II.,"Endothelial dysfunction is one of the earliest manifestations of atherosclerosis, contributing to its development and progression. Mental stress induces endothelial dysfunction through increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system, release of corticotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by cortisol, and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Mental-stress-induced increased output of the sympathetic nervous system and concomitant withdrawal of the parasympathetic inflammatory reflex results in systemic inflammation and activation of a neural-hematopoietic-arterial axis. This includes the brainstem and subcortical regions network, bone marrow activation, release of leukocytes into the circulation and their migration to the arterial wall and atherosclerotic plaques. Low-grade, sterile inflammation is involved in all steps of atherogenesis, from coronary plaque formation to destabilisation and rupture. Increased sympathetic tone may cause arterial smooth-muscle-cell proliferation, resulting in vascular hypertrophy, thus contributing to the development of hypertension. Emotional events also cause instability of cardiac repolarisation due to brain lateralised imbalance of cardiac autonomic nervous stimulation, which may lead to asymmetric repolarisation and arrhythmia. Acute emotional stress can also provoke severe catecholamine release, leading to direct myocyte injury due to calcium overload, known as myocytolysis, coronary microvascular vasoconstriction, and an increase in left ventricular afterload. These changes can trigger a heart failure syndrome mimicking acute myocardial infarction, characterised by transient left ventricular dysfunction and apical ballooning, known as stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy. Women are more prone than men to develop mental-stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI), probably reflecting gender differences in brain activation patterns during mental stress. Although guidelines on CV prevention recognise psychosocial factors as risk modifiers to improve risk prediction and decision making, the evidence that their assessment and treatment will prevent CAD needs further evaluation."
35832193,No,No,No,No,Heterogeneous Distribution of Genetic Mutations in Myosin Binding Protein-C Paralogs.,"Myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) is a sarcomeric protein which regulates the force of contraction in striated muscles. Mutations in the MYBPC family of genes, including slow skeletal (MYBPC1), fast skeletal (MYBPC2) and cardiac (MYBPC3), can result in cardiac and skeletal myopathies. Nonetheless, their evolutionary pattern, pathogenicity and impact on MyBP-C protein structure remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study aimed to systematically assess the evolutionarily conserved and epigenetic patterns of MYBPC family mutations. Leveraging a machine learning (ML) approach, the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) provided variants in MYBPC1, MYBPC2, and MYBPC3 genes. This was followed by an analysis with Ensembl's variant effect predictor (VEP), resulting in the identification of 8,618, 3,871, and 3,071 variants in MYBPC1, MYBPC2, and MYBPC3, respectively. Missense variants comprised 61%-66% of total variants in which the third nucleotide positions in the codons were highly altered. Arginine was the most mutated amino acid, important because most disease-causing mutations in MyBP-C proteins are arginine in origin. Domains C5 and C6 of MyBP-C were found to be hotspots for most mutations in the MyBP-C family of proteins. A high percentage of truncated mutations in cMyBP-C cause cardiomyopathies. Arginine and glutamate were the top hits in fMyBP-C and cMyBP-C, respectively, and tryptophan and tyrosine were the most common among the three paralogs changing to premature stop codons and causing protein truncations at the carboxyl terminus. A heterogeneous epigenetic pattern was identified among the three MYBP-C paralogs. Overall, it was shown that databases using computational approaches can facilitate diagnosis and drug discovery to treat muscle disorders caused by MYBPC mutations."
35364138,No,No,No,No,Diagnosis and Management of Rare Cardiomyopathies in Adult and Paediatric Patients. A Position Paper of the Italian Society of Cardiology (SIC) and Italian Society of Paediatric Cardiology (SICP).,"Cardiomyopathies (CMPs) are myocardial diseases in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality. Thought for a long time to be rare diseases, it is now clear that most of the CMPs can be easily observed in clinical practice. However, there is a group of specific heart muscle diseases that are rare in nature whose clinical/echocardiographic phenotypes resemble those of the four classical morphological subgroups of hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, arrhythmogenic CMPs. These rare CMPs, often but not solely diagnosed in infants and paediatric patients, should be more properly labelled as specific CMPs. Emerging consensus exists that these conditions require tailored investigation and management. Indeed, an appropriate understanding of these conditions is mandatory for early treatment and counselling. At present, however, the multisystemic and heterogeneous presentation of these entities is a challenge for clinicians, and time delay in diagnosis is a significant concern. The aim of this paper is to define practical recommendations for diagnosis and management of the rare CMPs in paediatric or adult age. A modified Delphi method was adopted to grade the recommendations proposed by each member of the writing committee."
35302338,No,No,No,No,Involvement of muscle satellite cell dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders: Expanding the portfolio of satellite cell-opathies.,"Neuromuscular disorders are a heterogeneous group of acquired or hereditary conditions that affect striated muscle function. The resulting decrease in muscle strength and motility irreversibly impacts quality of life. In addition to directly affecting skeletal muscle, pathogenesis can also arise from dysfunctional crosstalk between nerves and muscles, and may include cardiac impairment. Muscular weakness is often progressive and paralleled by continuous decline in the ability of skeletal muscle to functionally adapt and regenerate. Normally, the skeletal muscle resident stem cells, named satellite cells, ensure tissue homeostasis by providing myoblasts for growth, maintenance, repair and regeneration. We recently defined 'Satellite Cell-opathies' as those inherited neuromuscular conditions presenting satellite cell dysfunction in muscular dystrophies and myopathies (doi:10.1016/j.yexcr.2021.112906). Here, we expand the portfolio of Satellite Cell-opathies by evaluating the potential impairment of satellite cell function across all 16 categories of neuromuscular disorders, including those with mainly neurogenic and cardiac involvement. We explore the expression dynamics of myopathogenes, genes whose mutation leads to skeletal muscle pathogenesis, using transcriptomic analysis. This revealed that 45% of myopathogenes are differentially expressed during early satellite cell activation (0 - 5 hours). Of these 271 myopathogenes, 83 respond to Pax7, a master regulator of satellite cells. Our analysis suggests possible perturbation of satellite cell function in many neuromuscular disorders across all categories, including those where skeletal muscle pathology is not predominant. This characterisation further aids understanding of pathomechanisms and informs on development of prognostic and diagnostic tools, and ultimately, new therapeutics."
35054236,No,No,No,No,Deep Learning Supplants Visual Analysis by Experienced Operators for the Diagnosis of Cardiac Amyloidosis by Cine-CMR.,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis (CA) from cine-CMR (cardiac magnetic resonance) alone is not reliable. In this study, we tested if a convolutional neural network (CNN) could outperform the visual diagnosis of experienced operators. METHOD: 119 patients with cardiac amyloidosis and 122 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of other origins were retrospectively selected. Diastolic and systolic cine-CMR images were preprocessed and labeled. A dual-input visual geometry group (VGG ) model was used for binary image classification. All images belonging to the same patient were distributed in the same set. Accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated per frame and per patient from a 40% held-out test set. Results were compared to a visual analysis assessed by three experienced operators. RESULTS: frame-based comparisons between humans and a CNN provided an accuracy of 0.605 vs. 0.746 (p < 0.0008) and an AUC of 0.630 vs. 0.824 (p < 0.0001). Patient-based comparisons provided an accuracy of 0.660 vs. 0.825 (p < 0.008) and an AUC of 0.727 vs. 0.895 (p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: based on cine-CMR images alone, a CNN is able to discriminate cardiac amyloidosis from LVH of other origins better than experienced human operators (15 to 20 points more in absolute value for accuracy and AUC), demonstrating a unique capability to identify what the eyes cannot see through classical radiological analysis."
34603077,No,No,No,No,An Implementation of Patient-Specific Biventricular Mechanics Simulations With a Deep Learning and Computational Pipeline.,"Parameterised patient-specific models of the heart enable quantitative analysis of cardiac function as well as estimation of regional stress and intrinsic tissue stiffness. However, the development of personalised models and subsequent simulations have often required lengthy manual setup, from image labelling through to generating the finite element model and assigning boundary conditions. Recently, rapid patient-specific finite element modelling has been made possible through the use of machine learning techniques. In this paper, utilising multiple neural networks for image labelling and detection of valve landmarks, together with streamlined data integration, a pipeline for generating patient-specific biventricular models is applied to clinically-acquired data from a diverse cohort of individuals, including hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy patients and healthy volunteers. Valve motion from tracked landmarks as well as cavity volumes measured from labelled images are used to drive realistic motion and estimate passive tissue stiffness values. The neural networks are shown to accurately label cardiac regions and features for these diverse morphologies. Furthermore, differences in global intrinsic parameters, such as tissue anisotropy and normalised active tension, between groups illustrate respective underlying changes in tissue composition and/or structure as a result of pathology. This study shows the successful application of a generic pipeline for biventricular modelling, incorporating artificial intelligence solutions, within a diverse cohort."
34306738,No,No,No,No,Machine Learning Driven Contouring of High-Frequency Four-Dimensional Cardiac Ultrasound Data.,"Automatic boundary detection of 4D ultrasound (4DUS) cardiac data is a promising yet challenging application at the intersection of machine learning and medicine. Using recently developed murine 4DUS cardiac imaging data, we demonstrate here a set of three machine learning models that predict left ventricular wall kinematics along both the endo- and epi-cardial boundaries. Each model is fundamentally built on three key features: (1) the projection of raw US data to a lower dimensional subspace, (2) a smoothing spline basis across time, and (3) a strategic parameterization of the left ventricular boundaries. Model 1 is constructed such that boundary predictions are based on individual short-axis images, regardless of their relative position in the ventricle. Model 2 simultaneously incorporates parallel short-axis image data into their predictions. Model 3 builds on the multi-slice approach of model 2, but assists predictions with a single ground-truth position at end-diastole. To assess the performance of each model, Monte Carlo cross validation was used to assess the performance of each model on unseen data. For predicting the radial distance of the endocardium, models 1, 2, and 3 yielded average R(2) values of 0.41, 0.49, and 0.71, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations of the endocardial wall showed significantly closer predictions when using model 2 versus model 1 at a rate of 48.67%, and using model 3 versus model 2 at a rate of 83.50%. These finding suggest that a machine learning approach where multi-slice data are simultaneously used as input and predictions are aided by a single user input yields the most robust performance. Subsequently, we explore the how metrics of cardiac kinematics compare between ground-truth contours and predicted boundaries. We observed negligible deviations from ground-truth when using predicted boundaries alone, except in the case of early diastolic strain rate, providing confidence for the use of such machine learning models for rapid and reliable assessments of murine cardiac function. To our knowledge, this is the first application of machine learning to murine left ventricular 4DUS data. Future work will be needed to strengthen both model performance and applicability to different cardiac disease models."
34108678,No,No,No,No,Towards precision medicine in heart failure.,"The number of therapies for heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction has nearly doubled in the past decade. In addition, new therapies for HF caused by hypertrophic and infiltrative disease are emerging rapidly. Indeed, we are on the verge of a new era in HF in which insights into the biology of myocardial disease can be matched to an understanding of the genetic predisposition in an individual patient to inform precision approaches to therapy. In this Review, we summarize the biology of HF, emphasizing the causal relationships between genetic contributors and traditional structure-based remodelling outcomes, and highlight the mechanisms of action of traditional and novel therapeutics. We discuss the latest advances in our understanding of both the Mendelian genetics of cardiomyopathy and the complex genetics of the clinical syndrome presenting as HF. In the phenotypic domain, we discuss applications of machine learning for the subcategorization of HF in ways that might inform rational prescribing of medications. We aim to bridge the gap between the biology of the failing heart, its diverse clinical presentations and the range of medications that we can now use to treat it. We present a roadmap for the future of precision medicine in HF."
33926659,No,No,No,No,Lifespan Perspective on Congenital Heart Disease Research: JACC State-of-the-Art Review.,"More than 90% of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are nowadays surviving to adulthood and adults account for over two-thirds of the contemporary CHD population in Western countries. Although outcomes are improved, surgery does not cure CHD. Decades of longitudinal observational data are currently motivating a paradigm shift toward a lifespan perspective and proactive approach to CHD care. The aim of this review is to operationalize these emerging concepts by presenting new constructs in CHD research. These concepts include long-term trajectories and a life course epidemiology framework. Focusing on a precision health, we propose to integrate our current knowledge on the genome, phenome, and environome across the CHD lifespan. We also summarize the potential of technology, especially machine learning, to facilitate longitudinal research by embracing big data and multicenter lifelong data collection."
33554111,No,No,No,No,Wearable Technology and Analytics as a Complementary Toolkit to Optimize Workload and to Reduce Injury Burden.,"Wearable sensors enable the real-time and non-invasive monitoring of biomechanical, physiological, or biochemical parameters pertinent to the performance of athletes. Sports medicine researchers compile datasets involving a multitude of parameters that can often be time consuming to analyze in order to create value in an expeditious and accurate manner. Machine learning and artificial intelligence models may aid in the clinical decision-making process for sports scientists, team physicians, and athletic trainers in translating the data acquired from wearable sensors to accurately and efficiently make decisions regarding the health, safety, and performance of athletes. This narrative review discusses the application of commercial sensors utilized by sports teams today and the emergence of descriptive analytics to monitor the internal and external workload, hydration status, sleep, cardiovascular health, and return-to-sport status of athletes. This review is written for those who are interested in the application of wearable sensor data and data science to enhance performance and reduce injury burden in athletes of all ages."
33287829,No,No,No,No,Deep learning to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis from cardiovascular magnetic resonance.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is part of the diagnostic work-up for cardiac amyloidosis (CA). Deep learning (DL) is an application of artificial intelligence that may allow to automatically analyze CMR findings and establish the likelihood of CA. METHODS: 1.5 T CMR was performed in 206 subjects with suspected CA (n = 100, 49% with unexplained left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; n = 106, 51% with blood dyscrasia and suspected light-chain amyloidosis). Patients were randomly assigned to the training (n = 134, 65%), validation (n = 30, 15%), and testing subgroups (n = 42, 20%). Short axis, 2-chamber, 4-chamber late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images were evaluated by 3 networks (DL algorithms). The tags ""amyloidosis present"" or ""absent"" were attributed when the average probability of CA from the 3 networks was >/= 50% or < 50%, respectively. The DL strategy was compared to a machine learning (ML) algorithm considering all manually extracted features (LV volumes, mass and function, LGE pattern, early blood-pool darkening, pericardial and pleural effusion, etc.), to reproduce exam reading by an experienced operator. RESULTS: The DL strategy displayed good diagnostic accuracy (88%), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.982. The precision (positive predictive value), recall score (sensitivity), and F1 score (a measure of test accuracy) were 83%, 95%, and 89% respectively. A ML algorithm considering all CMR features had a similar diagnostic yield to DL strategy (AUC 0.952 vs. 0.982; p = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: A DL approach evaluating LGE acquisitions displayed a similar diagnostic performance for CA to a ML-based approach, which simulates CMR reading by experienced operators."
33123938,No,No,No,No,Automated analysis and detection of abnormalities in transaxial anatomical cardiovascular magnetic resonance images: a proof of concept study with potential to optimize image acquisition.,"The large number of available MRI sequences means patients cannot realistically undergo them all, so the range of sequences to be acquired during a scan are protocolled based on clinical details. Adapting this to unexpected findings identified early on in the scan requires experience and vigilance. We investigated whether deep learning of the images acquired in the first few minutes of a scan could provide an automated early alert of abnormal features. Anatomy sequences from 375 CMR scans were used as a training set. From these, we annotated 1500 individual slices and used these to train a convolutional neural network to perform automatic segmentation of the cardiac chambers, great vessels and any pleural effusions. 200 scans were used as a testing set. The system then assembled a 3D model of the thorax from which it made clinical measurements to identify important abnormalities. The system was successful in segmenting the anatomy slices (Dice 0.910) and identified multiple features which may guide further image acquisition. Diagnostic accuracy was 90.5% and 85.5% for left and right ventricular dilatation, 85% for left ventricular hypertrophy and 94.4% for ascending aorta dilatation. The area under ROC curve for diagnosing pleural effusions was 0.91. We present proof-of-concept that a neural network can segment and derive accurate clinical measurements from a 3D model of the thorax made from transaxial anatomy images acquired in the first few minutes of a scan. This early information could lead to dynamic adaptive scanning protocols, and by focusing scanner time appropriately and prioritizing cases for supervision and early reporting, improve patient experience and efficiency."

31653946,No,No,No,No,Genome-wide differential expression profiling of lncRNAs and mRNAs associated with early diabetic cardiomyopathy.,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy is one of the main causes of heart failure and death in patients with diabetes. There are no effective approaches to preventing its development in the clinic. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are increasingly recognized as important molecular players in cardiovascular disease. Herein we investigated the profiling of cardiac lncRNA and mRNA expression in type 2 diabetic db/db mice with and without early diabetic cardiomyopathy. We found that db/db mice developed cardiac hypertrophy with normal cardiac function at 6 weeks of age but with a decreased diastolic function at 20 weeks of age. LncRNA and mRNA transcripts were remarkably different in 20-week-old db/db mouse hearts compared with both nondiabetic and diabetic controls. Overall 1479 lncRNA transcripts and 1109 mRNA transcripts were aberrantly expressed in 6- and 20-week-old db/db hearts compared with nondiabetic controls. The lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network analysis revealed that 5 deregulated lncRNAs having maximum connections with differentially expressed mRNAs were BC038927, G730013B05Rik, 2700054A10Rik, AK089884, and Daw1. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these 5 lncRNAs are closely associated with membrane depolarization, action potential conduction, contraction of cardiac myocytes, and actin filament-based movement of cardiac cells. This study profiles differently expressed lncRNAs in type 2 mice with and without early diabetic cardiomyopathy and identifies BC038927, G730013B05Rik, 2700054A10Rik, AK089884, and Daw1 as the core lncRNA with high significance in diabetic cardiomyopathy."
31401975,No,No,No,No,Neural-network classification of cardiac disease from (31)P cardiovascular magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures of creatine kinase energy metabolism.,"BACKGROUND: The heart's energy demand per gram of tissue is the body's highest and creatine kinase (CK) metabolism, its primary energy reserve, is compromised in common heart diseases. Here, neural-network analysis is used to test whether noninvasive phosphorus ((31)P) cardiovascular magnetic resonance spectroscopy (CMRS) measurements of cardiac adenosine triphosphate (ATP) energy, phosphocreatine (PCr), the first-order CK reaction rate k(f), and the rate of ATP synthesis through CK (CK flux), can predict specific human heart disease and clinical severity. METHODS: The data comprised the extant 178 complete sets of PCr and ATP concentrations, k(f), and CK flux data from human CMRS studies performed on clinical 1.5 and 3 Tesla scanners. Healthy subjects and patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, dilated (DCM) or hypertrophic disease, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-IV heart failure (HF), or with anterior myocardial infarction are included. Three-layer neural-networks were created to classify disease and to differentiate DCM, hypertrophy and clinical NYHA class in HF patients using leave-one-out training. Network performance was assessed using 'confusion matrices' and 'area-under-the-curve' (AUC) analyses of 'receiver operating curves'. Possible methodological bias and network imbalance were tested by segregating 1.5 and 3 Tesla data, and by data augmentation by random interpolation of nearest neighbors, respectively. RESULTS: The network differentiated healthy, HF and non-HF cardiac disease with an overall accuracy of 84% and AUC > 90% for each category using the four CK metabolic parameters, alone. HF patients with DCM, hypertrophy, and different NYHA severity were differentiated with ~ 80% overall accuracy independent of CMRS methodology. CONCLUSIONS: While sample-size was limited in some sub-classes, a neural network classifier applied to noninvasive cardiac (31)P CMRS data, could serve as a metabolic biomarker for common disease types and HF severity with clinically-relevant accuracy. Moreover, the network's ability to individually classify disease and HF severity using CK metabolism alone, implies an intimate relationship between CK metabolism and disease, with subtle underlying phenotypic differences that enable their differentiation.

31356777,No,No,No,No,Demographic model for inheritable cardiac disease.,"The cardiac muscle proteins, generating and regulating energy transduction during a heartbeat, assemble in the sarcomere into a cyclical machine repetitively translating actin relative to myosin filaments. Myosin is the motor transducing ATP free energy into actin movement against resisting force. Cardiac myosin binding protein C (mybpc3) regulates shortening velocity probably by transient N-terminus binding to actin while its C-terminus strongly binds the myosin filament. Inheritable heart disease associated mutants frequently modify these proteins involving them in disease mechanisms. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) cause single residue substitutions with independent characteristics (sequence location, residue substitution, human demographic, and allele frequency) hypothesized to decide dependent phenotype and pathogenicity characteristics in a feed-forward neural network model. Trial models train and validate on a dynamic worldwide SNP database for cardiac muscle proteins then predict phenotype and pathogenicity for any single residue substitution in myosin, mybpc3, or actin. A separate Bayesian model formulates conditional probabilities for phenotype or pathogenicity given independent SNP characteristics. Neural/Bayes forecasting tests SNP pathogenicity vs (in)dependent SNP characteristics to assess individualized disease risk and in particular to elucidate gender and human subpopulation bias in disease. Evident subpopulation bias in myosin SNP pathogenicities imply myosin normally engages multiple sarcomere proteins functionally. Consistent with this observation, mybpc3 forms a third actomyosin interaction competing with myosin essential light chain N-terminus suggesting a novel strain-dependent mechanism adapting myosin force-velocity to load dynamics. The working models, and the integral myosin/mybpc3 motor concept, portends the wider considerations involved in understanding heart disease as a systemic maladaptation."

However, the underlying mechanisms of DCM remain incompletely understood presently. This study was designed to screen the potential molecules and pathways implicated with DCM. GSE26887 involving 5 control individuals and 7 DCM patients was selected from the GEO database to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DAVID was applied to perform gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was also constructed to visualize the interactions among these DEGs. To further validate significant genes and pathways, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blot were performed. A total of 236 DEGs were captured, including 134 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes. GO, KEGG, and the PPI network disclosed that inflammation, immune disorders, metabolic disturbance, and mitochondrial dysfunction were significantly enriched in the development of DCM. Notably, IL6 was an upregulated hub gene with the highest connectivity degree, suggesting that it may interact with a great many molecules and pathways. Meanwhile, SOCS3 was also one of the top 15 hub genes in the PPI network. Herein, we detected the protein level of STAT3 and SOCS3 in a mouse model with DCM. Western blot results showed that the protein level of SOCS3 was significantly lower while phosphorylated-STAT3 (P-STAT3) was activated in mice with DCM. In vitro results also uncovered the similar alterations of SOCS3 and P-STAT3 in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts induced by high glucose (HG). However, overexpression of SOCS3 could significantly reverse HG-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen synthesis of cardiac fibroblasts. Taken together, our analysis unveiled potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms in DCM, which could be helpful to the diagnosis and treatment of DCM."

29654880,No,No,No,No,Neural/Bayes network predictor for inheritable cardiac disease pathogenicity and phenotype.,"The cardiac muscle sarcomere contains multiple proteins contributing to contraction energy transduction and its regulation during a heartbeat. Inheritable heart disease mutants affect most of them but none more frequently than the ventricular myosin motor and cardiac myosin binding protein c (mybpc3). These co-localizing proteins have mybpc3 playing a regulatory role to the energy transducing motor. Residue substitution and functional domain assignment of each mutation in the protein sequence decides, under the direction of a sensible disease model, phenotype and pathogenicity. The unknown model mechanism is decided here using a method combing neural and Bayes networks. Missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are clues for the disease mechanism summarized in an extensive database collecting mutant sequence location and residue substitution as independent variables that imply the dependent disease phenotype and pathogenicity characteristics in 4 dimensional data points (4ddps). The SNP database contains entries with the majority having one or both dependent data entries unfulfilled. A neural network relating causes (mutant residue location and substitution) and effects (phenotype and pathogenicity) is trained, validated, and optimized using fulfilled 4ddps. It then predicts unfulfilled 4ddps providing the implicit disease model. A discrete Bayes network interprets fulfilled and predicted 4ddps with conditional probabilities for phenotype and pathogenicity given mutation location and residue substitution thus relating the neural network implicit model to explicit features of the motor and mybpc3 sequence and structural domains. Neural/Bayes network forecasting automates disease mechanism modeling by leveraging the world wide human missense SNP database that is in place and expanding."

In this case report, we demonstrate computed tomography virtual endoscopy for preoperative simulation, which enabled us to clearly image the relationship among the bulging septum, the expected myectomy area, and the structures deep in the left ventricle, such as the papillary muscle and abnormal muscular bundles, which are hidden by the hypertrophic septum, thus preventing visualization.

We hypothesized that body-mass index (BMI) and sex can affect gene expression profiles of cardiac hypertrophy. Human heart tissues were grouped according to sex (male, female), BMI (lean<25 kg/m(2), obese>30 kg/m(2)), or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and non-LVH nonfailed controls (NF). We identified 24 differentially expressed (DE) genes comparing female with male samples. In obese subgroup, there were 236 DE genes comparing LVH with NF; in lean subgroup, there were seven DE genes comparing LVH with NF. In female subgroup, we identified 1,320 significant genes comparing LVH with NF; in male subgroup, there were 1,383 significant genes comparing LVH with NF. There were seven significant genes comparing obese LVH with lean NF; comparing male obese LVH with male lean NF samples we found 106 significant genes; comparing female obese LVH with male lean NF, we found no significant genes. Using absolute value of log(2) fold-change > 2 or extremely small P value (10(-20)) as a criterion, we identified nine significant genes (HBA1, HBB, HIST1H2AC, GSTT1, MYL7, NPPA, NPPB, PDK4, PLA2G2A) in LVH, also found in published data set for ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy in heart failure. We identified a potential gene expression signature that distinguishes between patients with high BMI or between men and women with cardiac hypertrophy. Expression of established biomarkers atrial natriuretic peptide A (NPPA) and B (NPPB) were already significantly increased in hypertrophy compared with controls."

Human genetic studies, including genome-wide sequencing and SNP-array approaches, promise to reveal disease genes and mechanisms representing new therapeutic targets. In practice, however, identification of the actual genes contributing to disease pathogenesis has lagged behind identification of associated loci, thus limiting the clinical benefits. RESULTS: To aid in localizing causal genes, we develop a machine learning approach, Objective Prioritization for Enhanced Novelty (OPEN), which quantitatively prioritizes gene-disease associations based on a diverse group of genomic features. This approach uses only unbiased predictive features and thus is not hampered by a preference towards previously well-characterized genes. We demonstrate success in identifying genetic determinants for CVD-related traits, including cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and conduction system and cardiomyopathy phenotypes. Using OPEN, we prioritize genes, including FLNC, for association with increased left ventricular diameter, which is a defining feature of a prevalent cardiovascular disorder, dilated cardiomyopathy or DCM.

CONCLUSION: Our approach stands to assist interpretation of large-scale genetic studies without compromising their fundamentally unbiased nature."
23508261,No,No,No,No,A general framework for context-specific image segmentation using reinforcement learning.,"This paper presents an online reinforcement learning framework for medical image segmentation. The concept of context-specific segmentation is introduced such that the model is adaptive not only to a defined objective function but also to the user's intention and prior knowledge. Based on this concept, a general segmentation framework using reinforcement learning is proposed, which can assimilate specific user intention and behavior seamlessly in the background. The method is able to establish an implicit model for a large state-action space and generalizable to different image contents or segmentation requirements based on learning in situ. In order to demonstrate the practical value of the method, example applications of the technique to four different segmentation problems are presented. Detailed validation results have shown that the proposed framework is able to significantly reduce user interaction, while maintaining both segmentation accuracy and consistency."
17342195,No,No,No,No,"Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of a mixture of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (Cas No. 1746-01-6), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) (Cas No. 57117-31-4), and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) (Cas No. 57465-28-8) in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (gavage studies).","DIOXIN TOXIC EQUIVALENCY FACTOR EVALUATION OVERVIEW: Polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have the ability to bind to and activate the ligand-activated transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Structurally related compounds that bind to the AhR and exhibit biological actions similar to TCDD are commonly referred to as ""dioxin-like compounds"" (DLCs). Ambient human exposure to DLCs occurs through the ingestion of foods containing residues of DLCs that bioconcentrate through the food chain. Due to their lipophilicity and persistence, once internalized, they accumulate in body tissues, mainly adipose, resulting in chronic lifetime human exposure. Since human exposure to DLCs always involves a complex mixture, the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) methodology has been developed as a mathematical tool to assess the health risk posed by complex mixtures of these compounds. The TEF methodology is a relative potency scheme that ranks the dioxin-like activity of a compound relative to TCDD, which is the most potent congener. This allows for the estimation of the potential dioxin-like activity of a mixture of chemicals, based on a common mechanism of action involving an initial binding of DLCs to the AhR. The toxic equivalency of DLCs was nominated for evaluation because of the widespread human exposure to DLCs and the lack of data on the adequacy of the TEF methodology for predicting relative potency for cancer risk. To address this, the National Toxicology Program conducted a series of 2-year bioassays in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLCs and structurally related polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mixtures of these compounds. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF), and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) are not manufactured commercially other than for scientific research purposes. The main sources of TCDD and PeCDF releases into the environment are from metal smelting, refining, and processing; combustion and incineration sources; chemical manufacturing and processing; biological and photochemical processes; and existing reservior sources that reflect past releases. PCB mixtures were commercially produced and used in the electric power industry as dielectric insulating fluids in transformers and capacitors and used in hydraulic fluids, plastics, and paints. TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 were selected for study by the National Toxicology Program as part of the dioxin TEF evaluation to assess the cancer risk posed by complex mixtures of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and PCBs. The dioxin TEF evaluation includes conducting multiple 2-year rat bioassays to evaluate the relative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of DLC's, structurally related PCBs, and mixtures of these compounds. Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a mixture of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 (henceforth referred to as the TEF mixture) in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage for 14, 31, or 53 weeks or 2 years. While one of the aims of the dioxin TEF evaluation was a comparative analysis across studies, in this Technical Report only the results of the present study of the mixture of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 are presented and discussed. 2-YEAR STUDY: Groups of 81 female rats were administered 10, 22, 46, or 100 ng toxic equivalents (TEQ)/kg body weight in corn oil:acetone (99:1) by gavage, 5 days per week, for up to 105 weeks; a group of 81 vehicle control female rats received the corn oil/acetone vehicle alone. Actual doses used for each compound in the mixture were: for 10 ng TEQ/kg: 3.3 ng/kg TCDD, 6.6 ng/kg PeCDF, and 33.3 ng/kg PCB 126; for 22 ng TEQ/kg: 7.3 ng/kg TCDD, 14.5 ng/kg PeCDF, and 73.3 ng/kg PCB 126; for 46 ng TEQ/kg: 15.2 ng/kg TCDD, 30.4 ng/kg PeCDF, and 153 ng/kg PCB 126; and for 100 ng TEQ/kg: 33 ng/kg TCDD, 66 ng/kg PeCDF, and 333 ng/kg PCB 126. Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, or 53 weeks. Survival of all dosed groups of rats was similar to that of the vehicle control group. Mean body weights of the 22 and 46 ng TEQ/kg groups were less than those of the vehicle control groups after week 69 of the study. Mean body weights of the 100 ng TEQ/kg group were less than those of the vehicle control group after week 37 of the study. Thyroid Hormone Concentrations: Alterations in serum thyroid hormone concentrations were evaluated at the 14-, 31-, and 53-week interim evaluations. At 14, 31, and 53 weeks, there were dose-dependent reductions in total serum and free thyroxine concentrations. There were dose-dependent increases in serum triiodothyronine concentrations at 14 and 31 weeks. No changes in serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations were observed at any time point. Hepatic Cell Proliferation Data: To evaluate hepatocyte replication, analysis of labeling of replicating hepatocytes with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was conducted at the interim evaluations. At 14 weeks, no effects on the hepatocellular labeling index were observed in the dosed groups compared to the vehicle controls. At 31 and 53 weeks, the hepatocellular labeling index was significantly higher in the 46 and 100 ng TEQ/kg groups compared to the vehicle controls. Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Activities: To evaluate the expression of known dioxin-responsive genes, CYP1A1-associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP1A2-associated acetanilide-4-hydroxylase (A4H) activity were evaluated at the interim time points. Liver and lung EROD (CYP1A1) activities and hepatic A4H (CYP1A2) activities were significantly greater in all dosed groups than in the vehicle controls at all interim evaluations (14, 31, and 53 weeks). Determinations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 Concentrations in Tissues: Tissue concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 were analyzed in the fat, liver, lung, and blood at each interim evaluation and at the end of the 2-year study (105 weeks). The highest concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 were observed in the liver followed by fat. Liver and fat concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 at each interim evaluation and at 105 weeks were higher in groups with increasing doses of the mixture and generally increased with duration of dosing. In the lung, PeCDF was present at detectable concentrations in the 46 and 100 ng TEQ/kg groups at 14 and 31 weeks. Measurable concentrations of TCDD and PCB 126 were observed at 14 and 31 weeks in the lung of rats in all dosed groups with the highest concentrations observed in the 100 ng TEQ/kg group. At 53 weeks, concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 in the lung generally increased with increasing dose. At 105 weeks, detectable concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 in the lung were observed in all dosed groups. In blood, TCDD and PCB 126 concentrations at 14 and 31 weeks generally increased with increasing dose. Blood concentrations of PeCDF were detectable in the 46 and 100 ng TEQ/kg groups at 14 weeks and at 22 ng TEQ/kg or greater at 31 weeks. At 53 and 105 weeks, concentrations of TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 in blood generally increased with increasing dose and duration of dosing. Pathology and Statistical Analyses: Relative liver weights were significantly increased in all dosed groups at 14, 31, and 53 weeks and correlated with increased incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. Increasing duration of exposure led to an increase in the spectrum, incidence, and severity of nonneoplastic effects. The only significant effect at 14 weeks was increased incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy. At 53 weeks, there was a significant effect on the incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, pigmentation, focal fatty change, bile duct hyperplasia, and toxic hepatopathy. At 2 years, there were significant increases in the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and cholangiocarcinoma of the liver. There was an increase in hepatic toxicity characterized by increases in the incidences of numerous nonneoplastic lesions including hepatocyte hypertrophy, multinucleated hepatocytes, pigmentation, inflammation, diffuse fatty change, bile duct hyperplasia, oval cell hyperplasia, nodular hyperplasia, eosinophilic focus, cholangiofibrosis, bile duct cysts, necrosis, portal fibrosis, mixed cell focus, and toxic hepatopathy. In the lung, there were dose-dependent increases in the incidences of bronchiolar metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium at 53 weeks and at 2 years and squamous metaplasia at 2 years. At 2 years, there was a dose-dependent increase in the incidences of cystic keratinizing epithelioma. In the pancreas, there were increases in the incidences of numerous nonneoplastic lesions including arterial chronic active inflammation, acinar cytoplasmic vacuolization, acinar atrophy, chronic active inflammation, and duct dilatation. At 2 years, incidences of acinar adenoma or acinar carcinoma that exceeded the historical control ranges were seen in all dosed groups except the 100 ng TEQ/kg group. Treatment-related increases in the incidences of nonneoplastic lesions were seen in other organs including hyperplasia, cystic degeneration, atrophy, and cytoplasmic vacuolization of the adrenal cortex; gingival squamous hyperplasia of the oral mucosa; squamous metaplasia of the uterus; atrophy of the thymus (incidence and severity); chronic active inflammation of the ovary; nephropathy of the kidney (incidence and severity); cardiomyopathy; bone marrow hyperplasia; transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder; chronic active inflammation of the mesenteric artery; and follicular cell hypertrophy of the thyroid gland.

36982754,No,No,No,Yes,"Machine Learning Approaches in Diagnosis, Prognosis and Treatment Selection of Cardiac Amyloidosis.","Cardiac amyloidosis is an uncommon restrictive cardiomyopathy featuring an unregulated amyloid protein deposition that impairs organic function. Early cardiac amyloidosis diagnosis is generally delayed by indistinguishable clinical findings of more frequent hypertrophic diseases. Furthermore, amyloidosis is divided into various groups, according to a generally accepted taxonomy, based on the proteins that make up the amyloid deposits; a careful differentiation between the various forms of amyloidosis is necessary to undertake an adequate therapeutic treatment. Thus, cardiac amyloidosis is thought to be underdiagnosed, which delays necessary therapeutic procedures, diminishing quality of life and impairing clinical prognosis. The diagnostic work-up for cardiac amyloidosis begins with the identification of clinical features, electrocardiographic and imaging findings suggestive or compatible with cardiac amyloidosis, and often requires the histological demonstration of amyloid deposition. One approach to overcome the difficulty of an early diagnosis is the use of automated diagnostic algorithms. Machine learning enables the automatic extraction of salient information from ""raw data"" without the need for pre-processing methods based on the a priori knowledge of the human operator. This review attempts to assess the various diagnostic approaches and artificial intelligence computational techniques in the detection of cardiac amyloidosis."
31601877,No,No,No,Yes,Phase Space Reconstruction Based CVD Classifier Using Localized Features.,"This paper proposes a generalized Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR) based Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) classification methodology by exploiting the localized features of the ECG. The proposed methodology first extracts the ECG localized features including PR interval, QRS complex, and QT interval from the continuous ECG waveform using features extraction logic, then the PSR technique is applied to get the phase portraits of all the localized features. Based on the cleanliness and contour of the phase portraits CVD classification will be done. This is first of its kind approach where the localized features of ECG are being taken into considerations unlike the state-of-art approaches, where the entire ECG beats have been considered. The proposed methodology is generic and can be extended to most of the CVD cases. It is verified on the PTBDB and IAFDB databases by taking the CVD including Atrial Fibrillation, Myocardial Infarction, Bundle Branch Block, Cardiomyopathy, Dysrhythmia, and Hypertrophy. The methodology has been tested on 65 patients' data for the classification of abnormalities in PR interval, QRS complex, and QT interval. Based on the obtained statistical results, to detect the abnormality in PR interval, QRS complex and QT interval the Coefficient Variation (CV) should be greater than or equal to 0.1012, 0.083, 0.082 respectively with individual accuracy levels of 95.3%, 96.9%, and 98.5% respectively. To justify the clinical significance of the proposed methodology, the Confidence Interval (CI), the p-value using ANOVA have been computed. The p-value obtained is less than 0.05, and greater F-statistic values reveal the robust classification of CVD using localized features."
28400922,No,No,No,Yes,Pheochromocytoma and stress cardiomyopathy: Insight into pathogenesis.,"AIM: To investigate the occurrence of cardiomyopathy (CMP) in a cohort of patients with histologically proven pheochromocytoma (pheo), and to determine if catecholamine excess was causative of the left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. METHODS: A retrospective chart review spanning years 1998 through 2014 was undertaken and patients with a diagnosis of pheo confirmed with histopathologic examination were included. Presenting electrocardiograms and cardiac imaging studies were reviewed. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), ventriculography or single positron emission computed tomography imaging was evaluated and if significant abnormalities [left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or LV dysfunction] were noted in the pre operative period a follow up post-operative study was also analyzed. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was used to investigate independent predictors for outcomes of interest, LV dysfunction and LVH. RESULTS: We identified 18 patients with diagnosis of pheo confirmed on pathology. Mean age was 54.3 +/- 19.3 years and 11 (61.1%) patients were females. 50% of such patients had either resistant hypertension or labile blood pressures during hospitalization, which had raised suspicion for a pheo. Cardiac imaging studies were available for 12 (66.7%) patients at the time of inclusion into study and preceding the adrenalectomy. 7 (58.3%) patients with a TTE available for review had mild or more severe LVH while 3 (25%) patients had LV dysfunction of presumably acute onset. In a multivariate analysis, elevated catecholamine levels as assessed by urinary excretion of metabolites was not an independent predictor of development of LV systolic dysfunction or of presence of LVH on TTE. Two female patients with a preceding history of hypertension had marked LV hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Prolongation of the QTc interval was noted in 5 (27.8%) patients but no acute arrhythmias were observed in any patient. CONCLUSION: This study adds to the growing body of literature on the predilection of patients with pheochromocytomas to develop non-ischemic CMP. Degree of catecholamine excess as measured by urinary secretion of metabolites did not predict the development of CMP but 2 of 3 patients developed CMP in the setting of significant acute physiologic stress. Our findings provide support to the proposed etiologic role of elevated catecholamines in TC and other stress induced forms of CMP, however, activation of a brain-neural-cardiac axis from acute stress and local release of catecholamines but not chronic catecholamine elevations are likely to be responsible in pheo related CMP."

38638999,No,No,Yes,Yes,Postdevelopment Performance and Validation of the Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Electrocardiogram for Detection of Cardiac Amyloidosis.,"BACKGROUND: We have previously applied artificial intelligence (AI) to an electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect cardiac amyloidosis (CA). OBJECTIVES: In this validation study, the authors observe the postdevelopment performance of the AI-enhanced ECG to detect CA with respect to multiple potential confounders. METHODS: Amyloid patients diagnosed after algorithm development (June 2019-January 2022) with a 12-lead ECG were identified (n = 440) and were required to have CA. A 15:1 age- and sex-matched control group was identified (n = 6,600). Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) was determined for the cohort and subgroups. RESULTS: The average age was 70.4 +/- 10.3 years, 25.0% were female, and most patients were White (91.3%). In this validation, the AI-ECG for amyloidosis had an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82-0.86) for the overall cohort and between amyloid subtypes, which is a slight decrease from the original study (AUC 0.91). White, Black, and patients of ""other"" races had similar algorithm performance (AUC >0.81) with a decreased performance for Hispanic patients (AUC 0.66). Algorithm performance shift over time was not observed. Low ECG voltage and infarct pattern exhibited high AUC (>0.90), while left ventricular hypertrophy and left bundle branch block demonstrated lesser performance (AUC 0.75 and 0.76, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The AI-ECG for the detection of CA maintained an overall strong performance with respect to patient age, sex, race, and amyloid subtype. Lower performance was noted in left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ethnically diverse populations emphasizing the need for subgroup-specific validation efforts."
38247935,No,No,Yes,Yes,Cardiovascular Diseases Diagnosis Using an ECG Multi-Band Non-Linear Machine Learning Framework Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which encompass heart and blood vessel issues, stand as the leading cause of global mortality for many people. METHODS: the present study intends to perform discrimination between seven well-known CVDs (bundle branch block, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, and dysrhythmia) and one healthy control group, respectively, by feeding a set of machine learning (ML) models with 10 non-linear features extracted every 1 s from electrocardiography (ECG) lead signals of a well-known ECG database (PTB diagnostic ECG database) using multi-band analysis performed by discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The ML models were trained and tested using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, assessing the individual and combined capabilities of features, per each lead or combined, to distinguish between pairs of study groups and for conducting a comprehensive all vs. all analysis. RESULTS: the Accuracy discrimination results ranged between 73% and 100%, the Recall between 68% and 100%, and the AUC between 0.42 and 1. CONCLUSIONS: the results suggest that our method is a good tool for distinguishing CVDs, offering significant advantages over other studies that used the same dataset, including a multi-class comparison group (all vs. all), a wider range of binary comparisons, and the use of classical non-linear analysis under ECG multi-band analysis performed by DWT."
33770545,No,No,Yes,Yes,Convolutional neural network based automatic screening tool for cardiovascular diseases using different intervals of ECG signals.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Automatic screening tools can be applied to detect cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the leading cause of death worldwide. As an effective and non-invasive method, electrocardiogram (ECG) based approaches are widely used to identify CVDs. Hence, this paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify five CVDs using standard 12-lead ECG signals. METHODS: The Physiobank (PTB) ECG database is used in this study. Firstly, ECG signals are segmented into different intervals (one-second, two-seconds and three-seconds), without any wave detection, and three datasets are obtained. Secondly, as an alternative to any complex preprocessing, durations of raw ECG signals have been considered as input with simple min-max normalization. Lastly, a ten-fold cross-validation method is employed for one-second ECG signals and also tested on other two datasets (two-seconds and three-seconds). RESULTS: Comparing to the competing approaches, the proposed CNN acquires the highest performance, having an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.59%, 99.04%, and 99.87%, respectively, with one-second ECG signals. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained are 99.80%, 99.48%, and 99.93%, respectively, using two-seconds of signals with pre-trained proposed models. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of segmented ECG tested by three-seconds signals are 99.84%, 99.52%, and 99.95%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that the proposed system accomplishes high performance and keeps the characterizations in brief with flexibility at the same time, which means that it has the potential for implementation in a practical, real-time medical environment."
